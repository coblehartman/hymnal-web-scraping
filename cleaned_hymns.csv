Thou who almighty art, now rule in every heart, and ne'er from us depart, Spirit of power. 4 To thee, great One in Three, eternal praises be, hence evermore! Thy sovereign majesty may we in glory see, and to eternity love and adore. Informational Notes The author of this Trinitarian text is unknown, but this hymn has proved popular since the middle of the 18th century, partly because of its effective use of biblical metaphors, but also because of the strength of this tune, which was composed especially for these words.","1 Come, thou almighty King, help us thy name to sing; help us to praise: Father, all glorious, o'er all victorious, come, and reign over us, Ancient of Days. 2 Come, thou incarnate Word, merciful, mighty Lord, our prayer attend.

3,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create Womb of Life and Source of Being Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 Womb of life and source of being, home of every restless heart, in your arms the worlds awakened; you have loved us from the start. We, your children, gather 'round you, at the table you prepare. Sharing stories, tears, and laughter, we are nurtured by your care. 2 Word in flesh, our brother Jesus, born to bring us second birth, you have come to stand beside us, knowing weakness, knowing earth. Priest who shares our human struggles, Life of Life and Death of Death, risen Christ, come stand among us, send the Spirit by your breath. 3 Brooding Spirit, move among us; be our partner, be our friend. When our memory fails, remind us whose we are, what we intend. Labor with us; aid the birthing of the new world yet to be, free of servant, lord, and master, free for love and unity. 4 Mother, Brother, holy Partner; Father, Spirit, Only Son: we would praise your name forever, one-in-three and three-in-one. We would share your life, your passion, share your word of world made new, ever singing, ever praising, one with all, and one with you. Informational Notes Old and new metaphors drawn from Psalm 23; John 1:14, 14:26, 20:19–23; Hebrews 5:1–10; and Genesis 1:1–2 combine here to express faith in and praise to the Triune God, identified as Source, Word, and Spirit. The second line of stanza two is adapted from Charles Wesley (see no. 119).","1 Womb of life and source of being, home of every restless heart, in your arms the worlds awakened; you have loved us from the start.

4,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create Holy God, We Praise Your Name Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 Holy God, we praise your name; Lord of all, we bow before you. All on earth your scepter claim; all in heaven above adore you. Infinite your vast domain, everlasting is your reign. 2 Hark! The glad celestial hymn angel choirs above are raising; cherubim and seraphim, in unceasing chorus praising, fill the heavens with sweet accord: “Holy, holy, holy Lord!” 3 All apostles join the strain as your sacred name they hallow; prophets swell the glad refrain, and the blessed martyrs follow, and from morn to set of sun, through the church the song goes on. 4 Holy Father, Holy Son, Holy Spirit: three we name you, while in essence only one; undivided God we claim you, and adoring, bend the knee while we own the mystery. Informational Notes Based on an 18th-century German metrical version of a celebrated 5th-century Latin hymn, Te Deum laudamus, this abbreviated 19th-century English paraphrase is sung by both Protestants and Roman Catholics. It is set here to the tune composed and named for the German version.","1 Holy God, we praise your name; Lord of all, we bow before you.

5,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create God the Sculptor of the Mountains Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 God the sculptor of the mountains, God the miller of the sand, God the jeweler of the heavens, God the potter of the land: you are womb of all creation; we are formless; shape us now. 2 God the nuisance of the Pharaoh, God the cleaver of the sea, God the pillar in the darkness, God the beacon of the free: you are fount of all deliverance; we are aimless; lead us now. 3 God the dresser of the vineyard, God the planter of the wheat, God the reaper of the harvest, God the source of all we eat: you are host at every table; we are hungry; feed us now. 4 God the unexpected infant, God the calm, determined youth, God the table-turning prophet, God the resurrected truth: you are present every moment; we are searching; meet us now. Informational Notes Despite the great sweep of these stanzas, each one ends by describing how our human condition needs God’s help: formless, aimless, hungry, searching.  Each of these adjectives is followed by a related three-syllable petition: shape us now, lead us now, feed us now, meet us now.","1 God the sculptor of the mountains, God the miller of the sand, God the jeweler of the heavens, God the potter of the land: you are womb of all creation; we are formless; shape us now. 2 God the nuisance of the Pharaoh, God the cleaver of the sea, God the pillar in the darkness, God the beacon of the free: you are fount of all deliverance; we are aimless; lead us now. 3 God the dresser of the vineyard, God the planter of the wheat, God the reaper of the harvest, God the source of all we eat: you are host at every table; we are hungry; feed us now. 4 God the unexpected infant, God the calm, determined youth, God the table-turning prophet, God the resurrected truth: you are present every moment; we are searching; meet us now."
6,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create I Bind unto Myself Today Added to Favorites ‹ › Lyrics 1 I bind unto myself today the strong name of the Trinity by invocation of the same, the Three in One and One in Three. 2 I bind this day to me forever, by power of faith, Christ’s incarnation, his baptism in the Jordan river, his death on cross for my salvation, his bursting from the spiced tomb, his riding up the heavenly way, his coming at the day of doom, I bind unto myself today. 3 I bind unto myself today the virtues of the starlit heaven, the glorious sun’s life-giving ray, the whiteness of the moon at even, the flashing of the lightning free, the whirling wind’s tempestuous shocks, the stable earth, the deep salt sea around the old eternal rocks. 4 I bind unto myself today the power of God to hold and lead, God’s eye to watch, God’s might to stay, God’s ear to hearken to my need, the wisdom of my God to teach, God’s hand to guide, God’s shield to ward, the word of God to give me speech, God’s heavenly host to be my guard. 5 Christ be with me, Christ within me, Christ behind me, Christ before me, Christ beside me, Christ to win me, Christ to comfort and restore me. Christ beneath me, Christ above me, Christ in quiet, Christ in danger, Christ in hearts of all that love me, Christ in mouth of friend and stranger. 6 I bind unto myself the name, the strong name of the Trinity by invocation of the same, the Three in One and One in Three, of whom all nature has creation, eternal Father, Spirit, Word. Praise to the Lord of my salvation; salvation is of Christ the Lord! Informational Notes This great Trinitarian text belongs to a Celtic style of hymn known as a lorica, from the Latin word for “armor” or “breastplate.” In effect, it serves as both a statement of faith and a prayer for God’s protection. The two tunes are named for an Irish saint and an Irish heroine.","1 I bind unto myself today the strong name of the Trinity by invocation of the same, the Three in One and One in Three. 2 I bind this day to me forever, by power of faith, Christ’s incarnation, his baptism in the Jordan river, his death on cross for my salvation, his bursting from the spiced tomb, his riding up the heavenly way, his coming at the day of doom, I bind unto myself today. 3 I bind unto myself today the virtues of the starlit heaven, the glorious sun’s life-giving ray, the whiteness of the moon at even, the flashing of the lightning free, the whirling wind’s tempestuous shocks, the stable earth, the deep salt sea around the old eternal rocks. 4 I bind unto myself today the power of God to hold and lead, God’s eye to watch, God’s might to stay, God’s ear to hearken to my need, the wisdom of my God to teach, God’s hand to guide, God’s shield to ward, the word of God to give me speech, God’s heavenly host to be my guard. 5 Christ be with me, Christ within me, Christ behind me, Christ before me, Christ beside me, Christ to win me, Christ to comfort and restore me.

7,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create Mothering God, You Gave Me Birth Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 Mothering God, you gave me birth in the bright morning of this world. Creator, source of every breath, you are my rain, my wind, my sun. 2 Mothering Christ, you took my form, offering me your food of light, grain of life, and grape of love, your very body for my peace. 3 Mothering Spirit, nurturing one, in arms of patience hold me close, so that in faith I root and grow until I flower, until I know. Informational Notes As the tune name hints, this text is derived from images in the writings of the English medieval mystic, Julian of Norwich. In 1393 she wrote down an account of her sixteen remarkable visions experienced twenty years earlier; they formed the basis of her theology of God’s love.","1 Mothering God, you gave me birth in the bright morning of this world. Creator, source of every breath, you are my rain, my wind, my sun. 2 Mothering Christ, you took my form, offering me your food of light, grain of life, and grape of love, your very body for my peace. 3 Mothering Spirit, nurturing one, in arms of patience hold me close, so that in faith I root and grow until I flower, until I know."
8,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create Eternal Father, Strong to Save Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 Eternal Father, strong to save, whose arm has bound the restless wave, who bade the mighty ocean deep its own appointed limits keep: O hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea. 2 O Savior, whose almighty word the winds and waves submissive heard, who walked upon the foaming deep, and calm amid its rage did sleep: O hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea. 3 O Holy Spirit, who did brood upon the chaos wild and rude, and bade its angry tumult cease, and gave, for fierce confusion, peace: O hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea. 4 O Trinity of love and power, all travelers guard in danger's hour; from rock and tempest, fire and foe, protect them wheresoe'er they go; thus evermore shall rise to thee glad praise from air and land and sea. Informational Notes The year after this text was written for a student sailing to America, it was included in the most influential British hymnal of the 19th century. The tune especially composed for it preserves the ancient Roman name of the island where Paul was shipwrecked, now called Malta.","1 Eternal Father, strong to save, whose arm has bound the restless wave, who bade the mighty ocean deep its own appointed limits keep: O hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea. 2 O Savior, whose almighty word the winds and waves submissive heard, who walked upon the foaming deep, and calm amid its rage did sleep: O hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea. 3 O Holy Spirit, who did brood upon the chaos wild and rude, and bade its angry tumult cease, and gave, for fierce confusion, peace: O hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea. 4 O Trinity of love and power, all travelers guard in danger's hour; from rock and tempest, fire and foe, protect them wheresoe'er they go; thus evermore shall rise to thee glad praise from air and land and sea."
9,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create The Play of the Godhead Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 The play of the Godhead, the Trinity’s dance, embraces the earth in a sacred romance: with God the Creator, and Christ the true Son, entwined with the Spirit, a web daily spun in spangles of mystery, the great Three-in-One. 2 The warm mists of summer, cool waters that flow, turn crystal as ice when the wintry winds blow. The taproot that nurtures, the shoot growing free, the life-giving fruit, full and ripe on the tree: more mystic and wondrous, the great One-in-Three. 3 In God’s gracious image of co-equal parts, we gather as dancers, uniting our hearts. Men, women, and children, and all living things, we join in the round of bright nature that rings with rapture and rhythm: creation now sings! Informational Notes This text gives life to the theological term perichoresis, a mutual, encompassing interaction, sometimes called “the threefold dance of the Trinity.” Stanza two notes various “natural analogies” for the Trinity (steam/water/ice; root/shoot/fruit) that have been found inadequate.","1 The play of the Godhead, the Trinity’s dance, embraces the earth in a sacred romance: with God the Creator, and Christ the true Son, entwined with the Spirit, a web daily spun in spangles of mystery, the great Three-in-One. 2 The warm mists of summer, cool waters that flow, turn crystal as ice when the wintry winds blow.

Enthroned above the crashing waves, the God of grace and glory saves. Alleluia, alleluia! Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia! 2 The name of God is full of might: resounding thunder, flashing light. Alleluia, alleluia! The wilderness cannot contain the echoes of the great refrain: Alleluia, alleluia! Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia! 3 The name of God is wild and free, awhirl in holy mystery. Alleluia, alleluia! A secret wrapped in smoke and fire, still chanted by the temple choir: Alleluia, alleluia!

Let all the faithful people come; sing praise to God, the Three-in-One: Alleluia, alleluia! Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia! Informational Notes This sweeping paraphrase of Psalm 29 conveys a sense of the Jewish reverence for the sheer power of God’s name, regarded as too holy for mortal tongues to pronounce. In keeping with its appointment for Trinity Sunday, the final stanza gives the psalm a Christian interpretation.","1 Sing glory to the name of God, whose holy splendor shines abroad.

The swirling patterns of the Welsh tune add much energy to the text.","1 Source and Sovereign, Rock and Cloud, Fortress, Fountain, Shelter, Light, Judge, Defender, Mercy, Might, Life whose life all life endowed: Refrain: May the church at prayer recall that no single holy name but the truth behind them all is the God whom we proclaim. 2 Word and Wisdom, Root and Vine, Shepherd, Savior, Servant, Lamb, Well and Water, Bread and Wine, Way who leads us to I am:  (R) 3 Storm and Stillness, Breath and Dove, Thunder, Tempest, Whirlwind, Fire, Comfort, Counselor, Presence, Love, Energies that never tire: (R)"
12,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create Immortal, Invisible, God Only Wise Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 Immortal, invisible, God only wise, in light inaccessible hid from our eyes, most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days, almighty, victorious, thy great name we praise. 2 Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light, nor wanting, nor wasting, thou rulest in might: thy justice, like mountains high soaring above; thy clouds, which are fountains of goodness and love. 3 To all, life thou givest, to both great and small. In all life thou livest, the true life of all. We blossom and flourish like leaves on the tree, then wither and perish; but naught changeth thee. 4 Thou reignest in glory; thou dwellest in light. Thine angels adore thee, all veiling their sight. All praise we would render; O help us to see 'tis only the splendor of light hideth thee! Informational Notes The opening line of this hymn was inspired by the three divine attributes listed in 1 Timothy 1:17 (King James Version), and it continues by considering how God’s life exceeds our own finite existence. The text is well set to a Welsh melody shaped by many three-note units.","1 Immortal, invisible, God only wise, in light inaccessible hid from our eyes, most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days, almighty, victorious, thy great name we praise. 2 Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light, nor wanting, nor wasting, thou rulest in might: thy justice, like mountains high soaring above; thy clouds, which are fountains of goodness and love. 3 To all, life thou givest, to both great and small.

13,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create The Mighty God, with Power Speaks Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 The Mighty God with power speaks, and all the world obeys; from dawn until the setting sun, God’s wonder earth displays. The perfect beauty all around from Zion's height shines forth; and stars across the firmament so brightly beam their worth. 2 God comes not with a silent form, but riding on the winds; before God’s face, the raging storm its blast of thunder sends. All hail the Judge, in bold array, whose promise is to bless; who sees our sins, yet also feels our thirst for righteousness. 3 The heavens declare your justice, Lord, as endless as the sky; against the taunts of disbelief, our God will testify. Receive my heartfelt gift of thanks, as honor to your might; refresh my faith with each new day; protect me through the night. Informational Notes This paraphrase, set to a familiar English folk melody, focuses on the opening narrative section of Psalm 50 without attempting to summarize God’s speeches in the latter portion of the psalm. Both parts bear witness to God’s sovereignty, God’s justice, and God’s providence.","1 The Mighty God with power speaks, and all the world obeys; from dawn until the setting sun, God’s wonder earth displays.

It is set here to the tune that is customary in North America, though not elsewhere.","1 For the beauty of the earth, for the glory of the skies, for the love which from our birth over and around us lies: Refrain: Lord of all, to thee we raise this our hymn of grateful praise. 2 For the wonder of each hour of the day and of the night, hill and vale, and tree and flower, sun and moon, and stars of light:	(Refrain) 3 For the joy of ear and eye, for the heart and mind’s delight, for the mystic harmony linking sense to sound and sight: 	(Refrain) 4 For the joy of human love, brother, sister, parent, child, friends on earth, and friends above, for all gentle thoughts and mild: 	(Refrain) 5 For thyself, best gift divine to the world so freely given; for that great, great love of thine, peace on earth and joy in heaven: 	(Refrain)"

One of the earliest religious poems in the Italian language, it is made even more expansive by this broad, repetitive melody with interspersed “Alleluias.”","1 All creatures of our God and King, lift up your voice and with us sing, Alleluia!

My heart, which in the Lord rejoices, would then proclaim in grateful songs to all, wherever I might be, what great things God has done for me! 2 Let every power in me implanted, arise, keep silence now no more; put forth the strength that God has granted! Your noblest work is to adore! O soul and body, join to raise with heartfelt joy our Maker's praise! 3 You forest leaves so green and tender that dance for joy in summer air; you meadow grasses, bright and slender; you flowers so fragrant and so fair: you live to show God's praise alone. Join me to make God's glory known! 4 All creatures that have breath and motion, that throng the earth, the sea, the sky, come, share with me my heart's devotion; help me to sing God's praises high! My utmost powers can never quite declare the wonders of God's might! Informational Notes The German original of this hymn contained too many stanzas to sustain a unified theme. The four selected here place humankind in the midst of creation and form an effective song of praise to the Creator. As the tune name suggests, the music was later composed for these words.","1 O that I had a thousand voices to praise my God with thousand tongues! My heart, which in the Lord rejoices, would then proclaim in grateful songs to all, wherever I might be, what great things God has done for me! 2 Let every power in me implanted, arise, keep silence now no more; put forth the strength that God has granted!

Sing with the whole creation; a cosmic chorus raise: “To God alone be glory and everlasting praise!” Informational Notes This paraphrase of Psalm 148 reflects the spirit of praise linking Psalms 146–150. Of the two great themes found in these final five psalms—creation and deliverance—this psalm focuses on the former. The opening praise “from the heavens” is matched by praise “from the earth.”","1 Sing praise to God, you heavens! Sing praise, each shining light! Sing, planets in your orbits; sing, stars all burning bright! Sing praise, you winds and tempests, you driving rain and snow!

Informational Notes This recent paraphrase of Psalm 148 expands our awareness of the breadth of God’s creation by being set to a traditional Indonesian melody that has become the basis for one of the most widely known worship songs from Asia. It needs to be sung joyfully and at a lively tempo.","1 Hallelujah! Sing praise to your Creator, sun, moon, and stars and angels above.

Yet God is present to them all and also to us; for that we give praise.","1 God of great and God of small, God of one and God of all, God of weak and God of strong, God to whom all things belong, alleluia, alleluia, praise be to your name. 2 God of land and sky and sea, God of life and destiny, God of never-ending power, yet beside me every hour, alleluia, alleluia, praise be to your name. 3 God of silence, God of sound, God by whom the lost are found, God of day and darkest night, God whose love turns wrong to right, alleluia, alleluia, praise be to your name. 4 God of heaven and God of earth, God of death and God of birth, God of now and days before, God who reigns forevermore, alleluia, alleluia, praise be to your name."

Thy hands have set the heavens with stars; thy fingers spread the mountains and plains. Lo, at thy word the waters were formed. Deep seas obey thy voice. 2 Grant unto us communion with thee, thou star-abiding One. Come unto us and dwell with us. With thee are found the gifts of life. Bless us with life that has no end, eternal life with thee. Informational Notes First came the evocative Dakota chant, bearing a French name (“the lake that speaks”) for the site of a Native American mission in western Minnesota. That was where the original seven-stanza text based on Jeremiah 10:12–13 was written in the Dakota language to fit the tune.","1 Many and great, O God, are thy works, Maker of earth and sky.

We, created in your image, would a true reflection be of your justice, grace, and mercy and the truth that makes us free. 2 You have called us to be faithful in our life and ministry. We respond in grateful worship joined in one community. When we blur your gracious image, focus us and make us whole. Healed and strengthened as your people, we move onward toward your goal. 3 God, your word is still creating, calling us to life made new. Now reveal to us fresh vistas where there's work to dare and do. Keep us clear of all distortion. Polish us with loving care. Thus, new creatures in your image, we'll proclaim Christ everywhere. Informational Notes 23	God, You Spin the Whirling Planets

This text was written for the 1979 National Meeting of United Presbyterian Women, whose theme, “In the Image of God, ” is variously considered here as reflection, focus, distortion, and polishing for clarity. The words are well set to an anonymous 19th-century American tune.","1 God, you spin the whirling planets, fill the seas and spread the plain, mold the mountains, fashion blossoms, call forth sunshine, wind, and rain.

Great Creator, still creating, show us what we yet may do. 2 Proudly rise our modern cities, stately buildings row on row. Yet their windows, blank, unfeeling, stare on canyoned streets below, where the lonely drift unnoticed in the city’s ebb and flow, lost to purpose and to meaning, scarcely caring where they go. 3 We have ventured worlds undreamed of since the childhood of our race; known the ecstasy of winging though untraveled realms of space; probed the secrets of the atom, yielding unimagined power, facing us with life’s destruction or our most triumphant hour. 4 As each far horizon beckons, may it challenge us anew, children of creative purpose, serving others, honoring you. May our dreams prove rich with promise, each endeavor well begun. Great Creator, give us guidance till our goals and yours are one. Informational Notes 24	God, Who Stretched the Spangled Heavens

The crux of this text comes in the second stanza: if we dare to claim God-given abilities, we need also to show God-like compassion for the human needs that confront us daily. The earthy shape note tune provides a further reminder that we must not lose our heads in the clouds.","1 God, who stretched the spangled heavens infinite in time and place, flung the suns in burning radiance through the silent fields of space, we, your children in your likeness, share inventive powers with you.

We sing and praise your fame. Informational Notes The middle stanzas of this paraphrase of Psalm 8 probe the ancient but enduring paradox of declaring the grandeur of God’s creation while realizing how small mortals are in the midst of it all. These words are set to one of the most durable 18th-century English psalm tunes.","1 O Lord, our God, how excellent, how glorious is your name.

Informational Notes 26	Earth and All Stars!

This lively text was written for the 90th anniversary of St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota. Echoing Psalm 98, it is a prime example of a 20th-century hymn style based on phrases rather than complete sentences. The exuberant tune was created expressly for these words.","1 Earth and all stars! Loud rushing planets! Sing to the Lord a new song! Hail, wind, and rain! Loud blowing snowstorm!

27,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create Sacred the Body Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 Sacred the body God has created, temple of Spirit that dwells deep inside. Cherish each person; nurture relation. Treat flesh as holy, that love may abide. 2 Bodies are varied, made in all sizes, pale, full of color; both fragile and strong. Holy the difference, gift of the Maker, so let us honor each story and song. 3 Love respects persons, bodies and boundaries. Love does not batter, neglect, or abuse. Love touches gently, never coercing. Love leaves the other with power to choose. 4 Holy of holies, God ever loving, make us your temples; indwell all we do. May we be careful, tender and caring, so may our bodies give honor to you. Informational Notes Despite biblical directives to “honor God with your body” (1 Corinthians 6:20) and “offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God” (Romans 12:1), Christians have often scorned the body, failing to see how the mystery of the Incarnation continues in each person.","1 Sacred the body God has created, temple of Spirit that dwells deep inside. Cherish each person; nurture relation. Treat flesh as holy, that love may abide. 2 Bodies are varied, made in all sizes, pale, full of color; both fragile and strong.

28,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create You Are Before Me, Lord Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 You are before me, Lord, you are behind, and over me you have spread out your hand; such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too high to grasp, too great to understand. 2 Then from your Spirit where, Lord, shall I go; and from your presence where, Lord, shall I fly? If I ascend to heaven you are there, and still are with me if in hell I lie. 3 If I should take my flight into the dawn, if I should dwell on ocean's farthest shore, your mighty hand will rest upon me still, and your right hand will guard me evermore. 4 If I should say, ""Let darkness cover me, and I shall hide within the veil of night,"" surely the darkness is not dark to you: the night is as the day, the darkness light. 5 Search me, O God; search me and know my heart; try me, O God; my mind and spirit try; keep me from any path that gives you pain, and lead me in the everlasting way. Informational Notes The effectiveness of this paraphrase of Psalm 139:1–12, 23–24 partly derives from its imitation of the characteristic repetitions that give emotional intensity to Hebrew poetry.  Such patterns of repetitiveness can also be seen in the last three notes of each phrase of the tune.","1 You are before me, Lord, you are behind, and over me you have spread out your hand; such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too high to grasp, too great to understand. 2 Then from your Spirit where, Lord, shall I go; and from your presence where, Lord, shall I fly?

When I walk or lie down you are before me: ever the maker and keeper of my days. 2 You know my resting and my rising. You discern my purpose from afar, and with love everlasting you besiege me: in every moment of life or death, you are. 3 Before a word is on my tongue, Lord, you have known its meaning through and through. You are with me beyond my understanding: God of my present, my past, and future, too. 4 Although your Spirit is upon me, still I search for shelter from your light. There is nowhere on earth I can escape you: even the darkness is radiant in your sight. 5 For you created me and shaped me, gave me life within my mother’s womb. For the wonder of who I am, I praise you: safe in your hands, all creation is made new. Informational Notes Psalm 139 is one of the most introspective and most intimate of all the psalms, showing an acute mindfulness of God’s presence in all aspects of one’s life. Sometimes resisted, this omnipresence ultimately becomes a ground of hope, a promise that we never stray beyond God’s care.","1 O God, you search me and you know me. All my thoughts lie open to your gaze. When I walk or lie down you are before me: ever the maker and keeper of my days. 2 You know my resting and my rising.

Informational Notes These few stanzas are among the least florid of the two dozen that make up the rather flamboyant paraphrase of Psalm 136 written by the 15-year-old who would become one of the greatest English poets.  It is set here to a sprightly tune with Moravian connections.","1 Let us with a gladsome mind praise the Lord who is so kind: for God's mercies shall endure, ever faithful, ever sure. 2 God, with all-commanding might, filled the new-made world with light: for God's mercies shall endure, ever faithful, ever sure. 3 All things living God does feed; with full measure, meets their need: for God's mercies shall endure, ever faithful, ever sure. 4 Let us with a gladsome mind praise the Lord who is so kind: for God's mercies shall endure, ever faithful, ever sure."

And clouds arise, and tempests blow, by order from thy throne, while all that borrows life from thee is ever in thy care, and everywhere that we can be, thou, God, art present there. Informational Notes With minimal revision this text brings together six of the eight four-line stanzas in an 18th-century hymn written for children and originally headed “Praise for Creation and Providence.” The anonymous German tune provides a fitting sense of breadth and wonder.","1 I sing the mighty power of God that made the mountains rise, that spread the flowing seas abroad and built the lofty skies.

Riding on the wings of windstorm, flame and fire your bidding keep. 2 Lord, you laid the earth's foundation that it would be always sound. By the word of your commanding, you set forth each ocean's bound. Springs gush forth at your own bidding, giving drink to every field. Bird and beast and all your creatures in that coolness find thirst healed. 3 Grass you cause to grow for cattle, plants for us to cultivate. Food you bring forth from our labor, wine for joy and bread for plate. Trees you give the birds for shelter, mountain rock and cave for beast. Sun and moon both mark the seasons; in their light we work and feast. 4 Lord, how great are all your workings; wisdom marks them through and through. All the earth is your possession; great and small belong to you. Food you give in each due season; at your hand come all good things.

May these words and thoughts be pleasing, for in you my joy is found. Bless the Lord, my soul and being! With this song let praise abound. Informational Notes This 20th-century paraphrase of Psalm 104 is careful to include the details of creation that give this psalm its character. This comprehensive text is well served by its expansive Victorian tune, named for the town in Sussex where the composer lived in his later years.","1 Bless the Lord, my soul and being!

In our worldwide task of caring for the hungry and despairing, in the harvests we are sharing, God's will be done. 3 For the harvests of the Spirit, thanks be to God.

It also deals with stewardship, thanksgiving, and God’s endless gifts that continue to astound us. It is set to a familiar Welsh tune whose name means “throughout the night.”","1 For the fruit of all creation, thanks be to God. For the gifts to every nation, thanks be to God.

God's banners are o'er us; pure light goes before us, a pillar of fire shining forth in the night: till shadows have vanished, all fearfulness banished, as forward we travel from light into light. 2 By law God enforces, the stars in their courses, the sun in its orbit obediently shine; the hills and the mountains, the rivers and fountains, the depths of the ocean proclaim God divine. We too should be voicing our love and rejoicing; with glad adoration, a song let us raise, till all things now living unite in thanksgiving: to God in the highest, hosanna and praise! Informational Notes Written for an easy-to-sing folk melody familiar in England as well as Wales, this 20th-century North American text bears many resemblances to both Psalm 148 and the traditional canticle Benedicte, omnia opera Domini (Bless the Lord, all you works of the Lord).","1 Let all things now living a song of thanksgiving to God our Creator triumphantly raise; who fashioned and made us, protected and stayed us, by guiding us on to the end of our days.

Informational Notes These four stanzas present a paraphrase of Psalm 65:9–13, a celebration of God’s providential care, which in turn draws forth a song of praise from all creation. This text is set to an early 17th-century tune composed for an affirmative chorale text often used at funerals.","1 To bless the earth God sends us from heaven's abundant store the waters of the springtime, enriching it once more. 2 The seed by God provided is sown o'er hill and plain, and then come gentle showers to bless the springing grain. 3 God crowns the year with goodness; the earth God's mercy fills; the wilderness is fruitful, and joyful are the hills. 4 With grain the fields are covered; the flocks in pastures graze; all nature joins in singing a joyful song of praise."

40,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create Gods Word Is Upright Added to Favorites ‹ › Lyrics Refrain: God’s word is upright and true and faithful. God’s deeds are marvelous works of wonder. Righteousness, justice, and honor sit at God’s right hand in glory. And from divine loving-kindness all the earth is filled with mercy. And from divine loving-kindness all the earth is filled with mercy. (Estribillo) La palabra del Señor es recta y sus obras son maravillosas. La justicia y el derecho tienen tronos a su diestra y de su misericordia llena está toda la tierra; y de su misericordia llena está toda la tierra. Sprung from a word of God’s speaking, skies open, vast beyond measure; borne on the wind of God’s breathing, stars light the heavens in splendor. Gathering the seas in a storehouse, God confines the raging waters, pooling their deeps into wellsprings, carving streams through mountain gorges. Let all the earth and its peoples bow down before God in wonder, trembling to see works of power, building and breaking asunder. Foiling the plans of the wicked, God casts down the might of nations, only the plans of the Holy standing firm through generations. Informational Notes In this paraphrase of Psalm 33, the refrain is drawn from verses 4–5, stanza one from verses 6–7, and stanza two from verses 8–11.  The psalm itself is a condensed remembering of the creation story from Genesis 1:1–2:3 and the story of Israel’s deliverance from Exodus 3:1–15:21.","Refrain: God’s word is upright and true and faithful.

Informational Notes Addressing the first two stanzas to the singers of the hymn and the last three to God,
this free paraphrase of Psalm 104 recasts the psalmist’s imagery with baroque verve. Though it was first published in England, the tune has been more popular in North America than there.","1 O worship the King, all glorious above!

Informational Notes 42	Your Faithfulness, O Lord, Is Sure (Psalm 145)

This paraphrase of verses from the latter part of Psalm 145 celebrates God’s providential care for all creation, especially for those in any need or trouble. This anonymous German tune was apparently introduced to English hymnody by John Wesley in a 1742 music collection.","1 Your faithfulness, O Lord, is sure in all your words, your gracious deeds; you gently lift all burdened souls and well provide for all our needs. 2 The eyes of all are fixed on you; by you their wants are all supplied; your open hand is bountiful and every soul is satisfied. 3 Lord, you are just in all your ways, and kind in everything you do; forever near you stand to hear and help all those who call on you. 4 My mouth shall speak your praise, O Lord; my soul shall bless your holy name; let all things living join the song of praise, from age to age the same."

(Refrain) 3 You need not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day; though thousands fall about you, near you it shall not come. (Refrain) 4 For to his angels he’s given a command to guard you in all of your ways; upon their hands they will bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone. Informational Notes Although the body of this text is a paraphrase of Psalm 91, the refrain combines allusions to Exodus 19:4, Psalm 139:9, and Isaiah 40:13; 49:16. Written in response to the death of a friend’s father, this piece has been a source of consolation to many people.","1 You who dwell in the shelter of the Lord, who abide in his shadow for life, say to the Lord, “My refuge, my rock in whom I trust!” Refrain: And he will raise you up on eagles’ wings, bear you on the breath of dawn, make you to shine like the sun, and hold you in the palm of his hand. 2 The snare of the fowler will never capture you, and famine will bring you no fear: under his wings, your refuge, his faithfulness your shield.

Informational Notes This text was inspired by how the prophet Hosea describes the parental nature of God’s relationship with Israel (Hosea 11:1–19). The last stanza echoes Christ’s teachings about love of neighbor (Matthew 22:37–40/Mark 12:29–31) and care for “the least of these” (Matthew 25:31–46).","1 Like a mother who has borne us, held us close in her delight, fed us freely from her body, God has called us into life. 2 Like a father who has taught us, grasped our hand and been our guide, lifted us and healed our sorrows, God has walked with us in life. 3 Though as children we have wandered, placed our trust in power and might, left behind our brothers, sisters, God still calls us into life. 4 When we offer food and comfort, grasp our neighbor’s hand in love, tread the path of peace and justice, God still walks with us in life."

My help is from the Lord alone, who heaven and earth has made. 2 God will not let your foot be moved; your guardian never sleeps; God's watchful and unslumbering care protects and safely keeps. 3 Your faithful keeper is the Lord, your shelter and your shade. 'Neath sun or moon, by day or night, you shall not be afraid. 4 From evil God will keep you safe, provide for all you need. Your going out, your coming in, God will forever lead. Informational Notes Although the first stanza of this paraphrase of Psalm 121 draws heavily on 17th-century Scottish psalters, most of this version dates from the early 20th century.  In its original source the tune printed here is one of twelve not assigned for use with a specific psalm.","1 I to the hills will lift my eyes; from whence shall come my aid?

Informational Notes As this paraphrase of Psalm 127 makes clear, human beings need to recognize both that our efforts will be in vain without God’s help and that our blessings come from God. These enduring truths are linked to each other by this shape note tune that ends as it begins.","1 Unless the Lord the house shall build, the weary builders toil in vain; unless the Lord the city shield, the guards a useless watch maintain. 2 In vain you rise at morning break, and late your nightly vigils keep, and weary days of toil partake; for God's beloved there is sleep. 3 Like arrows in full quivers stored are children given in days of youth; for children are a great reward, a gift from God in very truth."

Informational Notes This paraphrase of Psalm 128 effectively communicates the central theme of this short psalm that would have been sung by pilgrims while making their way to Jerusalem: trusting in God’s sovereignty is the only true source of blessing, both for ourselves and for those we love.","1 Bless all who trust in God and walk within God’s ways; bless every soul whose happiness springs from the Lord’s own praise! 2 Let families be strong and sparkle bright as wine; let partners and let children thrive and flourish like the vine! 3 And since we may not boast such joys are ours by right, teach us, good Lord, to take your gifts with thanks and with delight."

That image may be based on Ezekiel 34:26, where God promises to send showers of blessing upon the people of the covenant.","Rain down; rain down; rain down your love on your people.

We praise you, living God! We praise your holy name: the first, the last, beyond all thought, and still the same! Informational Notes Shaped by its traditional Jewish tune, this selection of English stanzas conveys the essence of the Yigdal, a canticle based on a medieval Hebrew statement of faith about the nature of God and often used in synagogue worship, alternately chanted by cantor and congregation.","1 The God of Abraham praise, who reigns enthroned above, the Ancient of Eternal Days, the God of love!

Informational Notes This vivid text reminds us of two truths we often forget: how deeply our faith is rooted in God’s enduring covenant with the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and how much we can learn from their story. The tune began life as the setting for a family Christmas card.","1 Deep in the shadows of the past, far out from settled lands, some nomads traveled with their God across the desert sands.

You need not fear the journey, for I have pledged my word that you shall be my people and I will be your God.” 2 From Abraham and Sarah arose a pilgrim race, dependent for their journey on God’s abundant grace; and in their heart was written by God this saving word, “That you shall be my people and I will be your God.” 3 We of this generation on whom God’s hand is laid can journey to the future secure and unafraid, rejoicing in God’s goodness and trusting in this word, “That you shall be my people and I will be your God.” Informational Notes This hymn condenses the narrative of Genesis 17:1–22 and grounds it in the recurring statement of the covenant relationship between God and the people God has chosen. This Welsh tune also occurs in a minor version called LLANGLOFFAN, used elsewhere in this hymnal (see no. 362).","1 To Abraham and Sarah the call of God was clear: “Go forth and I will show you a country rich and fair.

(Refrain) 4 O let us all from bondage flee; let my people go! And let us all in Christ be free: let my people go! Informational Notes Nothing in Hebrew Scripture resonated more deeply with the experience of African Americans in North America than Israel’s slavery in Egypt. In this spiritual’s recurring line, “Let my people go,” past and present became one, as they still do for all who are oppressed.","1 When Israel was in Egypt's land, let my people go; oppressed so hard they could not stand, let my people go!

Yet we by faith are drawn to you and will your people prove, as on our hearts you write anew the covenant of love. Informational Notes Christians often fail to appreciate how much we can learn about God from the Hebrew Scriptures. This text draws on a variety of passages that call attention to God’s faithfulness toward the Chosen People and the promise of a new covenant written on the heart (Jeremiah 31:31–34).","1 O God, who gives us life and breath, who shapes us in the womb, who guards our lives from birth to death, then leads us from the tomb: deliver us from fears that kill the life we have from you.

When our life's sure end shall come, bring us to your heavenly home. Informational Notes This paraphrase of Psalm 66 maintains a corporate tone more suitable for congregational singing than does the original psalm, which moves to a personal narrative in its latter part. The reference to “all creation” is strengthened by the associations of the tune (see no. 14).","1 Make a joyful noise to God! All creation sings your praise!

Informational Notes This unrhymed 21st-century paraphrase effectively communicates the urgency of Psalm 68 and its celebration of God’s power, manifest both in destroying all that hinders God’s purposes and in caring for those who have no other helper. Such a God deserves our thanks and praise.","1 Come like driving wind, O God, let your enemies be smoke. Come like searing fire, O God, let your enemies be wax. 2 Let your people shout for joy; let them cheer and chant your name, singing of the path you take, riding on the glory clouds. 3 Orphan’s father, widow’s hope, grace from heaven for the earth, you bring home the dispossessed; you set slaves and prisoners free. 4 When you led your people out, marching through the wilderness, earth was shaking as you went, rain was pouring from the sky. 5 Sing to God, all round the earth, God whose freedom has no bound, God who speaks for all to hear, God whose blessing is our life."
56,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create Sing Out with Joy to God Our Strength Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 Sing out with joy to God our strength. The God of Jacob praise, who brought us forth from Egypt’s grip: from slavery we were saved. God promised to provide for us, to nurture and to feed, to fill our mouths with all good things, to give us all we need. 2 But we, your people, would not hear, nor listen to your voice. Our selfish wills would not submit, nor make your way our choice. You gave us to our stubborn hearts, their counsel to obey. We turned from all your promises, to walk in our own way. 3 You plead for us to hear your voice, to hearken and obey. You promise to subdue our foes, and sweep them all away. You pledge to give us all we need, with finest wheat supply, and give us honey from the rock, rich food to satisfy. Informational Notes A key word running through this paraphrase of Psalm 81 is “promise.” The first stanza recalls how God fulfilled the promise of deliverance from Egypt and protection in the wilderness. The final two stanzas admit that God’s promises were ignored, but they continue to be offered.","1 Sing out with joy to God our strength. The God of Jacob praise, who brought us forth from Egypt’s grip: from slavery we were saved.

O Holy One! Informational Notes The German theologian Rudolph Otto described holiness as mysterium tremendum et fascinans, a terrifying and fascinating mystery. The awareness of such a divine encounter lies behind Psalm 99, and this 21st-century paraphrase conveys how God remains both personal and unfathomable.","1 Tremble, O tremble!

The mountains skipped like rams; the hills like lambs skipped to and fro. 4 O sea, why did you run away? O Jordan, why turn tide? You mounts and hills, like rams and lambs, why leap on every side? 5 O tremble, earth, before the Lord; the God of Jacob fear; God made the rock a water pool, the stone a fountain clear. Informational Notes The events described in Psalm 114 form the essential elements of Israel’s story: exodus, provision in the wilderness, entry into the promised land. These events were all the result of God’s sovereignty, which not only amazes human beings but also evokes awe from creation.","1 When Israel was going forth from out of Egypt’s land, and Jacob’s house from foreign tongues they could not understand, 2 to be God’s holy dwelling place, God’s choice on Judah fell, and there as God’s dominion took God’s chosen Israel. 3 The sea beheld and fled away; the Jordan stopped its flow.

Glory in God’s holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice. Search for the Lord and the strength of the Lord; continually seek the face of God. Remember the marvels God has done, the wonders and the judgments of God’s mouth, O offspring of Abraham, God’s servant, O children of Jacob, God’s chosen. (Refrain) The Lord is our God, whose judgments prevail in all the world. The Lord has always been mindful of the covenant, the promise made for a thousand generations: The covenant made with Abraham, the oath sworn to Isaac, which God established as a statute for Jacob, and everlasting covenant for Israel. For God remembered the holy promise and Abraham, chosen to serve. So God led forth the people with gladness, the chosen ones with shouts of joy. (Refrain) Informational Notes This psalm refrain quotes (with a few modifications) Lamentations 3:22–23, and the double singing of the final two phrases accentuates a sense of wonder. Finding ways to put scripture, especially psalms, to music has long been a characteristic of the Reformed tradition.","Refrain: The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; God’s mercies never come to an end.

Informational Notes The good news of this paraphrase of Psalm 106 is that God does not give up on us when we are disobedient. As the history of God’s dealings with Israel demonstrates, divine mercy always outlasts human rebellion and waywardness. Though we rebel and stray, God’s love is steadfast.","1 Your endless love, your mighty acts surpass what words can tell; Lord, may the joys your people know be mine to share as well. 2 Our rebel forebears rarely grasped your mercy or your might; we need your mercy, just like them: we, too, do wrong not right. 3 Before a golden calf they bowed— an idol in your place!— until, by Moses’ faithful prayer, you drew them back to grace. 4 But when they spurned the promised land, you made your anger plain: they wandered long on desert paths, and served the Baals again. 5 Yet those whom once you sold in wrath, in mercy you restored; may we, like them, be gathered in to thank and praise you, Lord."

Informational Notes Celebrating God’s law in this paraphrase of the second half of Psalm 19 may seem odd if “law” is thought of simply as a list of things not to do. But in Jewish understanding, the law is seen as a gift, because it provides the signposts that show how to live as the people of God.","1 Your law, O Lord, is perfect, the simple making wise; how pure are your commandments, enlightening my eyes! 2 More to be sought than riches, your words are my soul’s wealth; their taste is sweet like honey, imparting life and health. 3 My strength and my redeemer, lawgiver and true light, my words and meditations make worthy in your sight."

Informational Notes In the three synoptic gospels (Matthew 22:37/Mark 12:30/Luke 10:27–28), Jesus identifies the great commandment with these precepts drawn from Deuteronomy 6:5. In all three accounts, this commandment is followed by a second, to “love your neighbor as yourself” (Leviticus 19:18).",Love the Lord your God with all your heart.

Give honor, thanks, and praise to God, the maker of all things and giver of our days. Informational Notes This hymn paraphrases the Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4–9), an ancient and central affirmation of Jewish monotheistic faith that observant Jews still recite twice a day. Jesus knew it well and called it the first and great commandment (Matthew 22:38/Mark 12:28–29/Luke 10:26–28).","1 The Lord is God, the Lord alone!

Your ways are my release. 3 O God, I love your knowledge, more precious than pure gold. It satisfies like honey, a sweetness on my tongue. It leads me to salvation’s door where you have spread your table. O, lead me to your home. Informational Notes Although this paraphrase is based on only a small part of Psalm 119, it incorporates many of the synonyms that weave through this extended acrostic psalm celebrating God’s Law: commandments, judgments, words, teachings, wisdom, statutes, laws, precepts, understandings, ways.","1 I long for your commandments; your judgments all are just.

This hymn from Rwanda brings together the vision of Isaiah (Isaiah 6:1–3) and its recollection in John’s apocalyptic vision of worship in the new Jerusalem (Revelation 4:8; 5:13). The last line of stanza two also suggests the Gloria in excelsis (expanded from Luke 2:14).","1 Heaven opened to Isaiah, showing him God’s glorious throne: Lord of might, high and exalted, temple flowing with his robe.

This becomes clearer if a leader or small group sings the stanzas, with the congregation joining on the refrain.","1 I, the Lord of sea and sky, I have heard my people cry.

Informational Notes This condensed 20th-century paraphrase of Psalm 126 sketches Israel’s central identifying narrative, the deliverance from bondage in Egypt, and uses it as a ground of hope for all who are now in distress. The modal tune created for these words gives them weight and urgency.","1 When God delivered Israel from bondage long ago, they thought that they were dreaming, but soon they turned to laughing and sang the song of joy, and sang the song of joy. 2 The godless nations round them could not deny that power; they cried, ""O see this marvel!""

This paraphrase brings Psalm 126 to life in two ways: by turning the “they” of the final verses of the psalm to “we,” and by adding a prayer for all who still wait for release from oppression.

Informational Notes A recurring refrain ends each verse of Psalm 136, so the stanzas of this paraphrase follow that pattern. This feature strongly suggests that this psalm was used in worship, with the narrative of God’s mighty deeds sung by a cantor and the congregation responding with the refrain.","1 We give thanks unto you, O God of might, for your love is never ending; we give thanks unto you, the God of gods, for your love is never ending. 2 In your wisdom and love you shaped the skies, for your love is never ending; you spread out the earth upon the sea, for your love is never ending. 3 You have filled all the skies with glory and light, for your love is never ending; the sun for the day and the moon for night, for your love is never ending. 4 From of old you have led your people in faith, for your love is never ending; you have shown your compassion, strength, and love, for your love is never ending. 5 You delivered the ones who called unto you, for your love is never ending; from bondage to freedom, you brought them forth, for your love is never ending. 6 You have opened the sea and brought your people through, for your love is never ending; brought them into a land that flows with life, for your love is never ending. 7 You remember your promise age to age, for your love is never ending; you show mercy on those of low degree, for your love is never ending. 8 You give food and life to all living things, for your love is never ending; we give thanks unto you, the God of all, for your love is never ending."

This is a hymn whose tune came first. Upon hearing it, the author recalled the watered garden of Isaiah 58:11, which in turn led to Isaiah 55:12, paraphrased in the refrain. Then came the stanzas, organized around their first two words: Light dawns, Love grows, Hope blooms.","1 Light dawns on a weary world when eyes begin to see all people’s dignity.

In a 1779 collection, the author indicated that this hymn is primarily based on Isaiah 30:20–21 with allusions to several other passages.","1 Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God.

I open wide my heart to thee; here, Lord, abide. Let me thy inner presence feel; thy grace and love in me reveal. Informational Notes Beginning as a paraphrase of Psalm 24:7–10, this text then applies the door imagery to the singer’s heart, and concludes with the individual’s welcome of the approaching Savior. It is set to a very effective anonymous 18th-century English tune that has served many texts.","1 Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates; behold the King of glory waits; the King of kings is drawing near; the Savior of the world is here. 2 Fling wide the portals of your heart; make it a temple, set apart from earthly use for heaven’s employ, adorned with prayer and love and joy. 3 Redeemer, come!

Earth from slumber wakes to listen to the stirring, faint within: seed of promise, deeply planted, child to spring from Jesse’s stem! Like the soil beneath the frostline, hearts grow soft to welcome him. 2 Heavy clouds that block the moonlight now begin to drift away. Diamond brilliance through the darkness shines the hope of coming day. Christ, the morning star of splendor, gleams within a world grown dim. Heaven’s ember fans to fullness; hearts grow warm to welcome him. 3 Christ, eternal Sun of justice, Christ, the rose of wisdom’s seed, come to bless with fire and fragrance hours of yearning, hurt, and need. In the lonely, in the stranger, in the outcast, hid from view: child who comes to grace the manger, teach our hearts to welcome you. Informational Notes This Advent text artfully interweaves what is hidden and what is revealed, primarily in the coming of the long-awaited Messiah. But Christ himself taught us about another hidden truth, his presence in the “least of these” (Matthew 25:40, 45), whom we are also called to welcome.","1 Now the heavens start to whisper, as the veil is growing thin.

Because the latter part of the text (Isaiah 52:10b) has yet to be accomplished, this is still our mission today.","Prepare the way of the Lord.

O let your face upon us shine and fill the world with love divine. Informational Notes This hymn shows how once-unconnected parts can work together. The text about John the Baptist was written in Latin in the 18th century and translated into English in the 19th century.  Similarly, the 17th-century melody was adapted to its present form in the 19th century.","1 On Jordan’s bank the Baptist’s cry announces that the Lord is nigh; awake and hearken, for he brings glad tidings of the King of kings! 2 Then cleansed be every life from sin; make straight the way for God within, and let us all our hearts prepare for Christ to come and enter there. 3 We hail you as our Savior, Lord, our refuge and our great reward; without your grace we waste away like flowers that wither and decay. 4 Stretch forth your hand; our health restore, and make us rise to fall no more.

Traveler, shadows take their flight; doubt and terror are withdrawn. Watchman, you may go your way; hasten to your quiet home. Traveler, we rejoice today, for Emmanuel has come! Informational Notes This unusual dialogue hymn alternates between the voice of a traveler and that of a watchman, setting up an exchange that creates parallels between the coming of dawn and the birth of Christ. The tune is named for a Welsh town whose name means “mouth of the bending river.”","1 Watchman, tell us of the night, what its signs of promise are.

You are on earth most blest; you are most blest, most blessed; God chose you, you are blest!” 3 But Mary was most troubled to hear the angel’s word. What was the angel saying? It troubled her to hear, to hear the angel’s message, it troubled her to hear. 4 “Fear not, for God is with you, and you shall bear a child. His name shall be called Jesus, God’s offspring from on high. And he shall reign forever, forever reign on high.” 5 “How shall this be?” said Mary, “I am not yet a wife.” The angel answered quickly, “The power of the Most High will come upon you shortly, your child shall be God’s child.” 6 As Mary heard the angel, she wondered at his words. “Behold, I am your handmaid,” she said unto her God. “So be it; I am ready according to your word.” Informational Notes This 20th-century ballad-like retelling of the Annunciation (Luke 1:26–38) displays many characteristics of a folksong style, especially repetition in both text and tune and short quotations included in the narrative. Such features help to make a song both memorable and singable.","1 To a maid whose name was Mary, the angel Gabriel came. “Fear not,” the angel told her, “I come to bring good news; good news I come to tell you, good news, I say, good news.” 2 “For you are highly favored by God the Lord of all, who even now is with you.

God lifted up my lowliness in many marvelous ways. 2 My God has done great things for me: yes, holy is God’s name. All people will declare me blessed, and blessings they shall claim. 3 From age to age to all who fear, such mercy love imparts, dispensing justice far and near, dismissing selfish hearts. 4 Love casts the mighty from their thrones, promotes the insecure, leaves hungry spirits satisfied; the rich seem suddenly poor. 5 Praise God, whose loving covenant supports those in distress, remembering past promises with present faithfulness. Informational Notes This 20th-century paraphrase is based on the Song of Mary (Luke 1:46–55), commonly known by its opening Latin word, Magnificat. This song of praise offers clear reminders that God’s purposes often lead to the reversal of human values, exalting the poor and dethroning the mighty.","1 My soul gives glory to my God; my heart pours out its praise.

By employing an energetic Irish folksong for its melody, this ballad-like paraphrase of the Magnificat, Mary’s song at her meeting with her relative Elizabeth (Luke 1:46–55), recaptures both the wonder and the faith of the young woman who first recognized what God was doing.","1 My soul cries out with a joyful shout that the God of my heart is great, and my spirit sings of the wondrous things that you bring to the ones who wait.

Night cannot this light subdue; let our faith shine ever new. 4 Praise we sing to Christ the Lord, virgin’s son, incarnate Word! To the holy Trinity praise we sing eternally.

Love is the gift of Christmas. Love! Love! Praise to you, God on high! Informational Notes Here is a chance to sing a familiar French carol tune with new words, the most important clearly being “Love.” The senses “seen and heard” (as in Acts 4:20 and elsewhere) organize the first two stanzas, while the third holds the summary statement: “Love is the gift of Christmas.”","1 Love has come: a light in the darkness!

Informational Notes This Christmas hymn gives us a rare glimpse of Martin Luther as a father creating verses for his children to sing at home on Christmas Eve for a retelling of Luke 2:8–14. The first three stanzas paraphrase the angel’s song, and the final two provide the human response.","1 “From heaven above to earth I come to bring good news to everyone!

Amen!"" Informational Notes The words of this carol first appeared in 1684 in a collection by an Irish bishop, Luke Wadding. Whether they were his own work or something gleaned from popular use is not clear. The tune name recalls that the tune was collected in 1904 from Mrs. Verrall of Monk’s Gate, Sussex.","1 On Christmas night all Christians sing, to hear the news the angels bring; on Christmas night all Christians sing, to hear the news the angels bring, news of great joy, news of great mirth, news of our merciful King’s birth. 2 Then why should we on earth be sad, since our Redeemer made us glad; then why should we on earth be sad, since our Redeemer made us glad, when from our sin he set us free, all for to gain our liberty? 3 When sin departs before his grace, then life and health come in its place; when sin departs before his grace, then life and health comes in its place; heaven and earth with joy may sing, all for to see the newborn King. 4 All out of darkness we have light, which made the angels sing this night; all out of darkness we have light, which made the angels sing this night: ""Glory to God in highest heaven; peace on earth and goodwill.

Informational Notes This French carol probably dates from the 1700s, though it was not printed until the following century. Because it uses a vernacular language for the narrative stanzas and Latin for the refrain, it belongs to a special category called “macaronic” or mixed-language texts.","1 Angels we have heard on high, sweetly singing o’er the plains, and the mountains in reply echoing their joyous strains.

Informational Notes This is one of the few instances where we can see how one Christmas carol has been built upon another.

It is set here to a psalm tune that is more than a century older than the words, though the two were not firmly joined until the mid-19th century.","1 While shepherds watched their flocks by night, all seated on the ground, the angel of the Lord came down, and glory shone around. 2 “Fear not,” said he, for mighty dread had seized their troubled mind: “Glad tidings of great joy I bring to you and humankind. 3 “To you, in David’s town this day, is born of David’s line the Savior, who is Christ the Lord, and this shall be the sign: 4 “The heavenly babe you there shall find to human view displayed, all humbly wrapped in swathing bands, and in a manger laid.” 5 Thus spoke the seraph, and forthwith appeared a shining throng of angels praising God, who thus addressed their joyful song: 6 “All glory be to God on high, and to the earth be peace; good will to all from highest heaven begin and never cease!”"

Informational Notes The “it” of the first line of this text by a Unitarian minister does not refer to the birth of Jesus, but to “that glorious song of old,” the angelic tidings of peace on earth.  The restored third stanza laments how often the noise of human strife has obscured that message.","1 It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old, from angels bending near the earth, to touch their harps of gold: “Peace on the earth, good will to all, from heaven’s all-gracious King”: the world in solemn stillness lay, to hear the angels sing. 2 Still through the cloven skies they come, with peaceful wings unfurled, and still their heavenly music floats o’er all the weary world: above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing, and ever o’er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing. 3 Yet with the woes of sin and strife the world has suffered long; beneath the heavenly hymn have rolled two thousand years of wrong; and we at war on earth hear not the tidings that they bring; O, hush the noise and cease the strife to hear the angels sing! 4 And you, beneath life’s crushing load, whose forms are bending low, who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow, look now, for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing: O, rest beside the weary road, and hear the angels sing. 5 For lo, the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old, when with the ever-circling years shall come the time foretold, when peace shall over all the earth its ancient splendors fling, and the whole world give back the song which now the angels sing."

Christ the babe is Lord of all! 2 Flocks were sleeping; shepherds keeping vigil till the morning new saw the glory, heard the story, tidings of the gospel true. Thus rejoicing, free from sorrow, praises voicing greet the morrow: Christ the babe was born for you! Christ the babe was born for you!"

It came, a floweret bright, amid the cold of winter, when half spent was the night. 2 Isaiah ‘twas foretold it, the rose I have in mind; with Mary we behold it, the virgin mother kind. To show God’s love aright she bore for us a Savior, when half spent was the night. 3 This flower, whose fragrance tender with sweetness fills the air, dispels with glorious splendor the darkness everywhere. Enfleshed, yet very God, from sin and death he saves us and lightens every load. Informational Notes Although the early copies of this 15th-century German text include many more stanzas than are printed here, this simpler, shorter form has much to commend it.  This early 17th-century harmonization of the traditional chorale melody invites and rewards singing in parts.","1 Lo, how a rose e’er blooming from tender stem hath sprung, of Jesse’s lineage coming, by faithful prophets sung.

Informational Notes This exuberant text, based on Isaiah 9:2–7, was the ninth of twelve stanzas in its original German hymn.  The chorale tune associated with this hymn went through many changes at the hands of later composers, reaching its present form in J.S. Bach’s Christmas Oratorio.","Break forth, O beauteous heavenly light, and usher in the morning. You shepherds, shudder not with fright, but hear the angel’s warning.

Informational Notes While Isaac Watts did not write this text strictly for Christmas use, he did purposely cast his paraphrase of Psalm 98:4–9 in Christian terms, titling it “The Messiah’s coming and kingdom.” So “the Lord” here is Jesus Christ, rather than the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.","1 Joy to the world, the Lord is come!

God’s ways continually exceed our claims to comprehend them.","1 Who would think that what was needed to transform and save the earth might not be a plan or army, proud in purpose, proved in worth?

Informational Notes Although this Latin carol for Christmas may have roots several centuries older than its 16th-century emergence, the text was all in one language until its 20th-century translator chose to adopt the original last two lines of the fourth stanza as a unifying refrain in all stanzas.","1 On this day earth shall ring with the song children sing to the Lord, Christ our King, born on earth to save us; him the Father gave us.

If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb; if I were a wise man, I would do my part; yet what I can I give him: give my heart. Informational Notes Though this text describes winter weather in England rather than in Palestine, the poet is using familiar surroundings as a means of making the Nativity more immediate and personal. The tune name honors a Gloucestershire village near the composer’s birthplace in Cheltenham.","1 In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan; earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone; snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow, in the bleak midwinter, long ago. 2 Our God, heaven cannot hold him, nor earth sustain; heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign: in the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed the Lord God incarnate, Jesus Christ. 3 Angels and archangels may have gathered there; cherubim and seraphim thronged the air; but his mother only, in her maiden bliss, worshiped the beloved with a kiss. 4 What can I give him, poor as I am?

(The tune name means “The flowering time is near.”)","1 Gentle Mary laid her child lowly in a manger; there he lay, the undefiled, to the world a stranger.

(Refrain) 3 And by the light of that same star three wise men came from country far; to seek for a king was their intent, and to follow the star wherever it went.

Informational Notes This text retells the story in Luke 2:22–39, usually called the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, which took place forty days after his birth. Mary, Joseph, and the Christ-child encounter there two devout people, Anna and Simeon, who identify this baby as the promised Messiah.","1 Mary and Joseph came to the temple brought the boy Jesus, offered him there.

All hail, in time appointed, your reign on earth begun! You come to break oppression, to set the captive free, to take away transgression and rule in equity. 2 You come with rescue speedy to those who suffer wrong, to help the poor and needy and bid the weak be strong; to give them songs for sighing, their darkness turn to light, whose souls, condemned and dying, are precious in your sight. 3 You shall come down like showers upon the fruitful earth; love, joy, and hope, like flowers, spring in your path to birth. Before you on the mountains shall peace, the herald, go, and righteousness in fountains from hill to valley flow. 4 All rulers bow before you, and gold and incense bring. All nations shall adore you; your praise all people sing. To you shall prayer unceasing and daily vows ascend. Your rule is still increasing; your rule is without end. Informational Notes Originally a celebration of God’s sovereignty, Psalm 72 has often been given a Christological interpretation, notably in Isaac Watts’ “Jesus Shall Reign” (see no. 265). The references to rulers here probably influenced the view that the Magi of Matthew 2 were kings (see no. 151).","1 All hail to God’s anointed, great David’s greater Son!

Informational Notes The first three stanzas here use an as/so structure to draw parallels between the coming of the Magi and the spiritual lives of the singers, summed up in the prayer of the fourth stanza. Even though this adapted German tune was named for him, the author did not care for it.","1 As with gladness men of old did the guiding star behold; as with joy they hailed its light, leading onward, beaming bright; so, most gracious Lord, may we evermore be led to thee. 2 As with joyful steps they sped, Savior, to thy lowly bed, there to bend the knee before thee, whom heaven and earth adore; so may we with willing feet ever seek thy mercy seat. 3 As they offered gifts most rare at thy manger, rude and bare, so may we with holy joy, pure and free from sin’s alloy, all our costliest treasures bring, Christ, to thee, our heavenly king. 4 Holy Jesus, every day keep us in the narrow way; and when earthly things are past, bring our ransomed souls at last where they need no star to guide, where no clouds thy glory hide."

(Refrain) Informational Notes Although Christians had begun by the 2nd century to speak of these visitors from eastern countries (Matthew 2:1–12) as “kings,” perhaps because of passages like Psalm 72:10 and Isaiah 60:3, it is more accurate to think of them as magi or astrologers, the scholars of their day.","1 We three kings of Orient are; bearing gifts we traverse afar, field and fountain, moor and mountain, following yonder star.

Informational Notes This 18th-century Latin text calls attention to three kinds of light: the light of the star leading the Magi to the Christ-child, the inward light inspiring their journey, and Christ who is the Light of the world. The simple unison melody unites everything in a gentle arc.","1 What star is this, with beams so bright, more lovely than the noonday light? ’Tis sent to announce a newborn king, glad tidings of our God to bring. 2 ’Tis now fulfilled what God decreed, “From Jacob shall a star proceed”; and lo! the eastern sages stand to read in heaven the Lord’s command. 3 While outward signs the star displays, an inward light the Lord conveys and urges them, with tender might, to seek the giver of the light. 4 O Jesus, while the star of grace impels us on to seek your face, let not our slothful hearts refuse the guidance of your light to use."

Informational Notes The Slaughter of the Innocents (Matthew 2:16–18) is not an event we like to think about, but this text shows how it connects to the ongoing suffering of parents and children in our world today. Only the love that led Christ to the cross can bear the weight of such human anguish.","1 In Bethlehem a newborn boy was hailed with songs of praise and joy.

Informational Notes The Latin text here, for which the musical setting was originally composed, is from Psalm 100:1. The English paraphrase gives this verse a Christian interpretation, much as Isaac Watts did when he paraphrased Psalm 98 to produce “Joy to the World!

Informational Notes Epiphany” means “manifestation” or “showing forth,” and this text cites key disclosures of Jesus as Messiah: the coming of the magi, his baptism by John the Baptist, the wedding at Cana.

Informational Notes By dismissing Jesus as “the carpenter” (Mark 6:3) or “the carpenter’s son” (Matthew 13:55), his neighbors convinced themselves that they could ignore his teaching.

165,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create The Glory of These Forty Days Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 The glory of these forty days we celebrate with songs of praise; for Christ, by whom all things were made, himself has fasted and has prayed. 2 Alone and fasting Moses saw the loving God who gave the law; and to Elijah, fasting, came the steeds and chariots of flame. 3 So Daniel trained his mystic sight, delivered from the lions’ might; and John, the Bridegroom’s friend, became the herald of Messiah’s name. 4 Then grant that we like them be true, consumed in fast and prayer with you; our spirits strengthen with your grace, and give us joy to see your face. Informational Notes Appropriate for singing at any time during Lent, this stately text connects Jesus’ wilderness fast with the solitary testing of other prophetic souls: Moses, Elijah, Daniel, and John the Baptist. This sturdy 16th-century chorale melody formed the basis of Bach’s Cantata 126.","1 The glory of these forty days we celebrate with songs of praise; for Christ, by whom all things were made, himself has fasted and has prayed. 2 Alone and fasting Moses saw the loving God who gave the law; and to Elijah, fasting, came the steeds and chariots of flame. 3 So Daniel trained his mystic sight, delivered from the lions’ might; and John, the Bridegroom’s friend, became the herald of Messiah’s name. 4 Then grant that we like them be true, consumed in fast and prayer with you; our spirits strengthen with your grace, and give us joy to see your face."

Informational Notes Like many of this author’s hymns, this text was written primarily for children but works equally well in reminding adults how Lent connects us with Christ’s temptation in the wilderness and prepares us for Easter. The 16th-century English psalm tune provides sturdy support.","1 Lord, who throughout these forty days for us did fast and pray, teach us with you to mourn our sins and close by you to stay. 2 As you with Satan did contend and did the victory win, O give us strength to persevere, in you to conquer sin. 3 And through these days of penitence, and through this Passiontide, yes, evermore, in life and death, O Lord, with us abide. 4 Abide with us, till when this life of suffering shall be past, an Easter of unending joy we may attain at last."
167,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create Forty Days and Forty Nights Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 Forty days and forty nights you were fasting in the wild; forty days and forty nights tempted, and yet undefiled. 2 Shall not we your sorrow share and from worldly joys abstain, fasting with unceasing prayer, strong with you to suffer pain? 3 Then if Satan on us press, flesh or spirit to assail, victor in the wilderness, grant that we not faint nor fail! 4 So shall we have peace divine: holier gladness ours shall be; round us, too, shall angels shine, such as served you faithfully. 5 Keep, O keep us, Savior dear, ever constant by your side, that with you we may appear at the eternal Eastertide. Informational Notes 167	Forty Days and Forty Nights

This text, given sharper focus by being reduced from nine stanzas to five, reflects both on Christ’s temptation in the wilderness and on the purpose and goal of Lent as preparation for Easter.  It pairs well with a 17th-century German chorale setting for Psalm 130.","1 Forty days and forty nights you were fasting in the wild; forty days and forty nights tempted, and yet undefiled. 2 Shall not we your sorrow share and from worldly joys abstain, fasting with unceasing prayer, strong with you to suffer pain? 3 Then if Satan on us press, flesh or spirit to assail, victor in the wilderness, grant that we not faint nor fail! 4 So shall we have peace divine: holier gladness ours shall be; round us, too, shall angels shine, such as served you faithfully. 5 Keep, O keep us, Savior dear, ever constant by your side, that with you we may appear at the eternal Eastertide."

The strong defender of my home, with you I have no fear. 3 Your holy angels bear me up and keep my feet secure. Though fierce and angry foes assail, in you my way is sure. 4 As often as I call to you, you kindly hear my prayer. In times of trouble and distress I rest in your own care. 5 All those who know your name on earth shall life abundant know. On all abiding in your love your saving grace bestow. Informational Notes The most familiar part of this paraphrase of Psalm 91 may be the third stanza, based on verses Satan quotes when tempting Jesus to throw himself off a pinnacle of the Temple (Matthew 4:5–6/Luke 4:9–11). Citing scripture outside the context of faith undercuts its true power.","1 Within your shelter, loving God, my refuge and my tower, I safely walk by day and night beneath your guiding power. 2 Because I trust in you alone, no evil shall come near.

This tune was created especially for these words.","1 *Dear Lord and Father of mankind, forgive our foolish ways; reclothe us in our rightful mind, in purer lives thy service find, in deeper reverence, praise. 2 In simple trust like theirs who heard beside the Syrian sea the gracious calling of the Lord, let us, like them, without a word rise up and follow thee. 3 O Sabbath rest by Galilee, O calm of hills above, where Jesus knelt to share with thee the silence of eternity, interpreted by love! 4 Drop thy still dews of quietness, till all our strivings cease; take from our souls the strain and stress, and let our ordered lives confess the beauty of thy peace. 5 Breathe through the heats of our desire thy coolness and thy balm; let sense be dumb, let flesh retire; speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire, O still, small voice of calm! *Or ""Dear Lord, Creator good and kind"""
170,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create You Walk along Our Shoreline Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 You walk along our shoreline where land meets unknown sea. We hear your voice of power, “Now come and follow me. And if you still will follow through storm and wave and shoal, then I will make you fishers but of the human soul.” 2 You call us, Christ, to gather the people of the earth. We cannot fish for only those lives we think have worth. We spread your net of gospel across the water’s face, our boat a common shelter for all found by your grace. 3 We cast our net, O Jesus; we cry the kingdom’s name; we work for love and justice; we learn to hope through pain. You call us, Lord, to gather God’s daughters and God’s sons, to let your judgment heal us so that all may be one. Informational Notes 170	You Walk along Our Shoreline

Based on Jesus’ calling of the disciples (Matthew 4:18–22/Mark 1:16–20/Luke 5:4–11), this hymn notes that their mode of fishing involved nets requiring the participation of more than one person. Likewise, in our work of love and justice we are called to bear witness in community.","1 You walk along our shoreline where land meets unknown sea.

171,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create A Sower Came from Ancient Hills Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 A Sower came from ancient hills and cast good seed abroad: his field, ten thousand human hearts; his seed, the word of God. And some who listened would not hear, and some who heard forgot. But some received in fertile soil the truth the Sower taught. 2 A Sower walked throughout the land and, everywhere he trod, he sowed his life because he was himself the Seed of God. But then, atop a barren hill, beneath a darkening sky, they threw God’s Seed on stony ground and left it there to die. 3 The Seed was buried deep in death beneath a blood-red sky, and deeper still was buried hope for those who watched him die. But then, in Joseph’s garden fair, as dawn broke o’er the land, the Seed, from three days’ silent sleep, awoke at God’s command! 4 O Christ, you come among us still, the Sower and the Seed. As once you sowed the truth of God in glowing word and deed, implant your Word in waiting hearts, and let it there take hold, until it bears in fruitful lives a harvest hundredfold. Informational Notes All three synoptic gospels record both the telling and the explanation of Jesus’ parable of the Sower (Matthew 13:3–8, 18–23/Mark 4:3–8, 14–20/Luke 8:5–8, 11–15). Because the seed equals “the word,” Jesus (as the Word made flesh) becomes the Seed in this expansion of the parable.","1 A Sower came from ancient hills and cast good seed abroad: his field, ten thousand human hearts; his seed, the word of God.

Similar words of blessing also occur in the Sermon on the Plain (Luke 6:20–23). Both sets of sayings reverse worldly values and offer a new understanding of God’s ways.","1 Blest are they, the poor in spirit; theirs is the kingdom of God.

The order has been partly rearranged (the second and first are interchanged) to create an ascending order of significance and to provide a context for the well-known third parable.","1 A woman and a coin: the coin is lost!

Informational Notes The author and composer wrote the first stanza and folk-style tune after attending a Bible study on Matthew 6:33. The later stanzas, based respectively on Matthew 7:7 and Matthew 4:4 emerged anonymously.

Take my yoke, I am beside you; take and learn humility.” 4 “Rest in me, O weary traveler; rest in me and do not fear. Rest in me, my heart is gentle; rest and cast away your care.” Informational Notes This paraphrase and expansion of Matthew 11:28–30 by a Canadian minister is structured so that the first three syllables of each stanza provide the hymn’s skeleton and summary. The immediacy of the text is enhanced by the folksong-like setting later composed for it.","1 “Come to me, O weary traveler; come to me with your distress; come to me, you heavy burdened; come to me and find your rest.” 2 “Do not fear, my yoke is easy; do not fear, my burden's light; do not fear the path before you; do not run from me in fright.” 3 “Take my yoke and leave your troubles; take my yoke and come with me.

Similarly, the first half of the music gradually moves upward, while the direction of the second half is downward, enhancing a sense of centeredness.","Calm to the waves. Calm to the wind.

Informational Notes This text reproduces Matthew 25:34–39 so faithfully that it can appropriately be regarded as a paraphrase of that passage; but like all effective paraphrases, it adds just enough detail to give the familiar language a sense of freshness and immediacy that helps us hear it anew.","1 ""Come now, you blessed, eat at my table,"" said Jesus Christ to the righteous above.

Informational Notes This translation of a 15th-century Latin devotional text is set here to a majestic 15th-century tune celebrating the victory of an English king; they combine to evoke the awe and wonder of that moment of revelation the three disciples experienced in Christ’s Transfiguration.","1 O wondrous sight, O vision fair of glory that the church shall share, which Christ upon the mountain shows, where brighter than the sun he glows! 2 From age to age the tale declare, how with the three disciples there, where Moses and Elijah meet, the Lord holds converse high and sweet. 3 The law and prophets there have place, two chosen witnesses of grace; the Father's voice from out the cloud proclaims his only Son aloud. 4 With shining face and bright array Christ deigns to manifest today what glory shall be theirs above who joy in God with perfect love. 5 And faithful hearts are raised on high by this great vision's mystery, for which in joyful strains we raise the voice of prayer, the hymn of praise."

Informational Notes The first two stanzas of this 20th-century Transfiguration hymn guide singers through a contemplation of the disciples’ experience of that event.  The final stanza becomes a corporate prayer for enlightenment and for a renewed sense of commitment to doing God’s will.","1 Swiftly pass the clouds of glory, heaven's voice, the dazzling light; Moses and Elijah vanish; Christ alone commands the height!

Here we pray for new assurance that our faith is not in vain, searching like those first disciples for a sign both clear and plain. 2 Light breaks through our clouds and shadows; splendor bathes the flesh-joined Word; Moses and Elijah marvel as the heavenly voice is heard. Eyes and hearts behold with wonder how the law and prophets meet: Christ, with garments drenched in brightness, stands transfigured and complete. 3 Strengthened by this glimpse of glory, fearful lest our faith decline, we like Peter find it tempting to remain and build a shrine. But true worship gives us courage to proclaim what we profess, that our daily lives may prove us people of the God we bless. Informational Notes Through this Transfiguration hymn runs an implicit comparison between the attitudes and assumptions of the three disciples on that mountain and the expectations of present-day Christians as they gather for worship. This event is reported in Matthew 17:1-9/Mark 9:2–9/Luke 9: 28–36.","1 We have come at Christ’s own bidding to this high and holy place, where we wait with hope and longing for some token of God’s grace.

(Refrain) Informational Notes While the reference to Jesus as the Light of the world (John 8:12, 9:5) can be understood generally, this hymn is perhaps best understood as a response to the Transfiguration (Matthew 17:1–8/Mark 9:2–8/Luke 9:28–36).

As her brood shelters under her wings she gives the love of God to her nest.

As the hen tends her young, so for them he spent himself to seek and to heal. O! what joy to be with Christ Jesus, hear his voice, O! sheer delight, and receive his servant care, all before the coming night. 3 So gather round once again, friends, touched by fading glow of sun's gold, and recount all our frail human hopes, the dreams of young and stories of old. O! what joy to pray close together, kneeling as one family, by a mother's love embraced in the blessed Trinity. Informational Notes In the image of a mother hen taking her brood under her wings, this evening hymn from the Philippines connects farmyard experience and Jesus’ lament over Jerusalem (Matthew 23:37/Luke 13:34). The composer has described the tune as being like a bird jumping from branch to branch.","1 When twilight comes and the sun sets, mother hen prepares for night's rest.

O may we ever praise him with heart and life and voice, and in his blissful presence eternally rejoice. Informational Notes The opening two stanzas narrate the first Palm Sunday in the past tense, but the third stanza shifts to the present tense to emphasize what current singers do and believe. The repeated elements in this anonymous German tune suggest the repetitive patterns in a crowd’s chant.","1 Hosanna, loud hosanna, the little children sang; through pillared court and temple the joyful anthem rang.

This Mexican hymn, appropriate for the beginning of worship on Passion/Palm Sunday, captures the crowd’s enthusiasm.","1 Filled with excitement, all the happy throng spread cloaks and branches on the city streets.

With rare perfume she filled the room, presiding and anointing. A prophet-woman broke a jar, the sneers of scorn defying. With rare perfume she filled the room, preparing Christ for dying. 2 A faithful woman left a tomb by Love’s divine commission. She saw; she heard; she preached the Word, arising from submission. A faithful woman left a tomb, with resurrection gospel. She saw; she heard; she preached the Word, apostle to apostles. 3 Though woman-wisdom, woman-truth, for centuries were hidden, unsung, unwritten, and unheard, derided and forbidden, the Spirit’s breath, the Spirit’s fire, on free and slave descending, can tumble our dividing walls, our shame and sadness mending. 4 The Spirit knows; the Spirit calls, by Love’s divine ordaining, the friends we need, to serve and lead, their powers and gifts unchaining. The Spirit knows; the Spirit calls, from women, men and children, the friends we need, to serve and lead. Rejoice, and make them welcome!

Whatever burdens may bow us down, he by his cross shall lift us up. 3 And after supper he washed their feet, for service, too, is sacrament. In Christ our joy shall be made complete: sent out to serve, as he was sent. 4 No end there is! We depart in peace. He loves beyond our uttermost: in every room in our Father's house Christ will be there, as Lord and Host. Informational Notes This text brings together the two New Testament traditions regarding Jesus’ final evening with his disciples: the Synoptic account of the Last Supper (Matthew 26:26–29/Mark 14:22–25/Luke 22:14–20) and the Fourth Gospel’s report of his washing the disciples’ feet (John 13:3–17).","1 An upper room did our Lord prepare for those he loved until the end: and his disciples still gather there to celebrate their risen friend. 2 A lasting gift Jesus gave his own: to share his bread, his loving cup.

206,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create This Is the Night Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 This is the night, dear friends, the night for weeping, when powers of darkness overcome the day, the night the faithful mourn the weight of evil whereby our sins the Son of Man betray. 2 This night the traitor, wolf within the sheepfold, betrays himself into his victim’s will, the Lamb of God for sacrifice preparing: sin brings about the cure for sin’s own ill. 3 This night Christ institutes his holy supper, blest food and drink for heart and soul and mind; this night injustice joins its hand to treason’s, and buys the ransom-price of humankind. 4 This night the Lord by slaves shall be arrested, he who destroys our slavery to sin; accused of crime, to criminals be given, that judgment on the righteous Judge begin. 5 O make us sharers, Savior, of your Passion, that we may share your glory that shall be; let us pass through these three dark nights of sorrow to Easter’s laughter and its liberty. Informational Notes This text conveys well the paradox of despair and expectancy felt on Maundy Thursday. The somber repetition of “this night” here contrasts with and prepares for the joyful “this is the night” repeated in the Exsultet, the ancient Easter hymn at the lighting of the paschal candle.","1 This is the night, dear friends, the night for weeping, when powers of darkness overcome the day, the night the faithful mourn the weight of evil whereby our sins the Son of Man betray. 2 This night the traitor, wolf within the sheepfold, betrays himself into his victim’s will, the Lamb of God for sacrifice preparing: sin brings about the cure for sin’s own ill. 3 This night Christ institutes his holy supper, blest food and drink for heart and soul and mind; this night injustice joins its hand to treason’s, and buys the ransom-price of humankind. 4 This night the Lord by slaves shall be arrested, he who destroys our slavery to sin; accused of crime, to criminals be given, that judgment on the righteous Judge begin. 5 O make us sharers, Savior, of your Passion, that we may share your glory that shall be; let us pass through these three dark nights of sorrow to Easter’s laughter and its liberty."

(Refrain) Informational Notes This text is unusual among Passion hymns because it bridges a longer narrative than most, including the events from the Last Supper through the Crucifixion that are often treated separately. As the tune name suggests, this hymn could be used effectively in a Tenebrae service.","1 Sharing Paschal bread and wine as the daylight ebbs away, friends at table join to dine.

Informational Notes This 20th-century paraphrase follows the structure of Psalm 41 by devoting the first stanza to a general statement about God’s favor bestowed on those who are merciful to the poor. The remaining stanzas provide the details of a first-person testimony to this general principle.","1 O blest are they who in their love compassion hold for those in need; for they shall find, when faced by foes, the Lord is their defense indeed. 2 When all the evils earth can dream are cast on me, my faith to break, their rage I temper through God’s grace, and bear them boldly for God’s sake. 3 The hands which shared my broken bread, my love with their deceit repaid; and friends whose trust I counted mine have left me wounded and betrayed. 4 To me, O Lord, in mercy turn; your favor, my most treasured prize; my mouth shall sing redemption’s song, and tears of love wash clean my eyes."

O who am I that for my sake my Lord should take frail flesh, and die? 2 He came from heaven’s throne salvation to bestow; the world that was his own would not its Savior know. But O my Friend, my Friend indeed, who at my need his life did spend! 3 Sometimes we strew his way, and his sweet praises sing, resounding all the day hosannas to our King. Then ""Crucify!"" is all our breath, and for his death we thirst and cry. 4 Unheeding, we will have our dear Lord made away, a murderer to save, the prince of life to slay. Yet steadfast he to suffering goes, that he his foes from thence might free. 5 Here might I stay and sing, no story so divine: never was love, dear King, never was grief like thine. This is my Friend, in whose sweet praise I all my days could gladly spend. Informational Notes The opening line here could equally well have been a courtier’s lament for a secret affair, but it soon becomes a path into a vivid and poignant reflection on Christ’s Passion. This 17th-century text is beautifully embraced by its sensitive and lyrical 20th-century tune.","1 My song is love unknown, my Savior's love to me, love to the loveless shown that they might lovely be.

210,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create Lord, Why Have You Forsaken Me Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 Lord, why have you forsaken me, and why are you so far away from my complaint and my distress poured out before you night and day? 2 Yet you are holy, and the songs of praise of Israel are your throne; when our ancestors called on you, you saved them, rescued all your own. 3 But I am mocked and put to scorn. All those who see me laugh and say, ""You trust in God, so let us see the help of God to whom you pray."" 4 Yet you, O Lord, have been my God and only hope since I was born. With trouble near me, none can help. My Savior, leave me not forlorn. Informational Notes Although Psalm 22 paraphrased here begins in despair keen enough to be repeated on the lips of a dying Jesus (Matthew 27:46/Mark 15:34), it is replete with a faith that withstands even the mockery of disbelievers. The spareness of the shape note tune fits the text well.","1 Lord, why have you forsaken me, and why are you so far away from my complaint and my distress poured out before you night and day? 2 Yet you are holy, and the songs of praise of Israel are your throne; when our ancestors called on you, you saved them, rescued all your own. 3 But I am mocked and put to scorn.

Shelter me beneath your shadow when my hour of death draws nigh. 4 In its wake, send vindication; to its darkness, show your face. Bring me to my resurrection clothed in garments of your grace. Informational Notes This paraphrase emphasizes the prayerful qualities of Psalm 17 by keeping the focus on the relationship between the psalmist and God, rather than denouncing the faults of the enemy. This is a helpful reminder that our prayers need to be grounded in honest and unpretentious faith.","1 Hear, O Lord, my plea for justice; listen to my heartfelt prayer. In your just deliberation may I find redemption there. 2 Test my heart for its affliction; purify my soul with fire; let my mortal tongue speak wisdom, righteousness be my desire. 3 Keep me, Lord, in sure protection, as the apple of your eye.

Would he devote that sacred head for sinners such as I! 2 Was it for sins that I have done he suffered on the tree? Amazing pity! Grace unknown! And love beyond degree! 3 Well might the sun in darkness hide and shut its glories in, when Christ, the great Redeemer, died for human creatures' sin. 4 But drops of grief can ne'er repay the debt of love I owe; here, Lord, I give myself away; 'tis all that I can do. Informational Notes Much like this author’s “When I survey the wondrous cross” (nos. 223, 224), this more introspective treatment of Christ’s crucifixion calls forth self-sacrifice from the beholder.  It is set here to a tune that may well have originated as an 18th-century Scottish folksong.","1 Alas! And did my Savior bleed, and did my Sovereign die! Would he devote that sacred head for sinners such as I! 2 Was it for sins that I have done he suffered on the tree? Amazing pity! Grace unknown!

213,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create In the Cross of Christ I Glory Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 In the cross of Christ I glory, towering o’er the wrecks of time; all the light of sacred story gathers round its head sublime. 2 When the woes of life o’er-take me, hopes deceive, and fears annoy, never shall the cross forsake me; lo, it glows with peace and joy. 3 When the sun of bliss is beaming light and love upon my way, from the cross the radiance streaming adds more luster to the day. 4 Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure, by the cross are sanctified; peace is there that knows no measure, joys that through all time abide. 5 In the cross of Christ I glory, towering o’er the wrecks of time; all the light of sacred story gathers round its head sublime. Informational Notes Like Isaac Watts’ “When I Survey the Wondrous Cross” (nos. 223, 224), this hymn is a reflection on Galatians 6:14, but this text is more abstract and devotes no attention to the person hanging on the cross. The tune is named for a soloist in the composer’s Connecticut choir.","1 In the cross of Christ I glory, towering o’er the wrecks of time; all the light of sacred story gathers round its head sublime. 2 When the woes of life o’er-take me, hopes deceive, and fears annoy, never shall the cross forsake me; lo, it glows with peace and joy. 3 When the sun of bliss is beaming light and love upon my way, from the cross the radiance streaming adds more luster to the day. 4 Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure, by the cross are sanctified; peace is there that knows no measure, joys that through all time abide. 5 In the cross of Christ I glory, towering o’er the wrecks of time; all the light of sacred story gathers round its head sublime."

I put my spirit in your hands and call upon your name. 2 Deliver me from hidden snares, from sorrow, pain, and strife. When troubles seems to smother me, take heed, and save my life! 3 Be gracious, God, in my distress, and dry my bitter tears. My life is spent in misery; I sigh away my years. 4 I am a wretched sight to see: a broken, empty thing, with only terror all around, and deathly whispering. 5 And yet I trust in you, O God; your covenant still stands. Redeem me, in your faithful love: my life is in your hands. Informational Notes What John Calvin said about Psalm 31:5 can be applied to this paraphrase of the psalm as a whole: it is one of the places in scripture “most suitable for correcting distrust.” That verse was on Jesus’ dying lips (Luke 23:46), and this psalm is appointed for Passion/Palm Sunday.","1 You are my refuge, faithful God; you shelter me from shame. I put my spirit in your hands and call upon your name. 2 Deliver me from hidden snares, from sorrow, pain, and strife. When troubles seems to smother me, take heed, and save my life! 3 Be gracious, God, in my distress, and dry my bitter tears.

Informational Notes With its ballad-like repetitions before and after each stanza’s central narrative lines, this meditative text needs performance in order to be effective. Its haunting melody proves the means of convincing us that the only adequate response to “wondrous love” is to “sing on.”","1 What wondrous love is this, O my soul, O my soul, what wondrous love is this, O my soul!

I take, O cross, thy shadow for my abiding place; I ask no other sunshine than the sunshine of his face; content to let the world go by, to know no gain or loss, my sinful self my only shame, my glory all the cross. Informational Notes For sheer intensity of feeling few hymns can match this meditation on the cross; impressive images and strong contrasts combine to give the text its ardor. The passionate language is augmented by the highly chromatic tune later composed for these words.","1 Beneath the cross of Jesus I fain would take my stand, the shadow of a mighty rock within a weary land; a home within the wilderness, a rest upon the way, from the burning of the noontide heat, and the burden of the day. 2 Upon the cross of Jesus mine eye at times can see the very dying form of One who suffered there for me; and from my stricken heart with tears two wonders I confess: the wonders of redeeming love and my unworthiness.

Informational Notes The first stanza of this text is based on John 19:17, 30 and the second and third stanzas on Hebrews 4:14–16. These passages and others provide the basis for the classic understanding of the atonement that sees Christ’s redeeming work as a victory over all the powers of evil.","1 On a barren hilltop just outside the walls of an ancient city as the evening falls, speaks a dying figure hanging on a tree, saying ""It is finished,"" words of victory. 2 Tested just as we are, in a world of strife, through the pain and conflict of a human life, here at last completed with his final breath is a life triumphant over sin and death. 3 Let us then come boldly to the heavenly throne, where our human weakness is so fully known, and the mercy given by which we are freed, and the grace provided for our time of need."

Informational Notes This beautiful English paraphrase of a German meditation on Christ’s Passion bears testimony to the unobtrusive poetic skill and musical sensitivity of a future Poet Laureate of England. The associated chorale is no less carefully crafted and rewards singing in parts.","1 Ah, holy Jesus, how hast thou offended, that we to judge thee have in hate pretended?

The call-and-response singing style also provides a means of affirming the communal wisdom expressed in recurring phrases and refrains.","1 They crucified my Lord, and he never said a mumbalin’ word; they crucified my Lord, and he never said a mumbalin’ word.

O the pangs his soul sustained! Shun not suffering, shame, or loss; learn from him to bear the cross. 3 Calvary’s mournful mountain climb; there, adoring at his feet, mark that miracle of time, God’s own sacrifice complete; “It is finished!” hear him cry; learn from Jesus Christ to die. 4 Early hasten to the tomb where they laid his breathless clay: all is solitude and gloom. Who has taken him away? Christ is risen! He meets our eyes. Savior, teach us so to rise. Informational Notes The composer intended this tune for “Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me” (no. 438), but its solemn tone and small range make it an effective setting for this series of somber vignettes portraying what Christians can learn from Christ: to pray, to bear the cross, to die, and to rise.","1 Go to dark Gethsemane, all who feel the tempter’s power; your Redeemer’s conflict see; watch with him one bitter hour; turn not from his griefs away; learn from Jesus Christ to pray. 2 Follow to the judgment hall; view the Lord of life arraigned; O the wormwood and the gall!

O make me thine forever; and should I fainting be, Lord, let me never, never outlive my love to thee. Informational Notes This poignant hymn originated in a series of Holy Week meditations focused on the parts of Christ’s crucified body: feet, knees, hands, side, breast, heart, face. First joined to secular words, this chorale melody has appeared with this text since the mid-17th century.","1 O sacred head, now wounded, with grief and shame weighed down; now scornfully surrounded with thorns, thine only crown; O sacred head, what glory, what bliss till now was thine!

This Man of Sorrows, born to loss, acquainted with our grief: this Christ of God now crucified astonishes belief. 2 In all the victims of our age, the battered and the bruised, Christ lives again, alike with them by human sin abused: ascending on a cross to die, descending into hell; in torment, suffering, scorn, and pain, we meet our God as well. 3 Forgive us, Lord, as you forgave with your expiring breath the ones whose guilty hands, like ours, required a guiltless death. O mystery of such costly love, O depth of grace revealed: in scourge-marked flesh, we find our Christ, and by his stripes are healed. Informational Notes Since apostolic times (see Acts 8:26–39), Christians have seen parallels between the Fourth Servant Song (Isaiah 52:13–53:12) and Christ’s Passion. This reflection on that passage reminds us how the suffering Christ continues to be present in the victimized people of our own day.","1 Rejected and despised by men and women of our race, he bears transgression’s wounding weight and anguish mars his face.

Informational Notes This familiar text from the beginning of the 18th century grew out of Isaac Watts’ desire to give Christians the ability to sing about gospel events.  It is set here to a very restrained tune from the early 19th century inspired by the patterns of Gregorian chant.","1 When I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of glory died, my richest gain I count but loss, and pour contempt on all my pride. 2 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast, save in the death of Christ my God; all the vain things that charm me most, I sacrifice them to his blood. 3 See, from his head, his hands, his feet, sorrow and love flow mingled down; did e’er such love and sorrow meet, or thorns compose so rich a crown? 4 Were the whole realm of nature mine, that were a present far too small; love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all."

Hallelujah! 2 Our Savior Jesus, God’s own Son, here in our stead descended; the knot of sin has been undone; the reign of death is ended. Christ has crushed the power of hell; now death is but an empty shell. Its sting is lost forever! Hallelujah! 3 Here the true Paschal Lamb we see, whom God so freely gave us. He died on the accursed tree so strong his love to save us. See, his blood now marks our door: faith points to it; death passes o'er, and Satan cannot harm us. Hallelujah! 4 So let us keep the festival where-to the Lord invites us; Christ is the very joy of all, the sun that warms and lights us. Now his grace to us imparts eternal sunshine to our hearts; the night of sin is ended! Hallelujah!"

Informational Notes This hymn focuses on Mary Magdalene, the first witness to Christ’s Resurrection (John 20:1–18). Her frame of mind turns from sorrow and apprehension to joy and proclamation in the middle stanza when the supposed gardener calls her by name, and she recognizes the risen Christ.","1 Woman, weeping in the garden, who has pushed the stone aside?

Informational Notes In 1968 Easter fell ten days after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., and this text was written to express an Easter hope while mindful of that terrible event. Buoyed by a triple-arched tune, it affirms the presence of a wounded, risen Christ with all who suffer.","1 Christ is alive! Let Christians sing. The cross stands empty to the sky.

Informational Notes Although there were some traditional Easter carols, this hybrid one has been created by grafting a 20th-century English text onto a late 15th-century French tune. The allegory of the dying and rising grain as a parallel for Christ’s Resurrection is probably based on John 12:24.","1 Now the green blade rises from the buried grain, wheat that in dark earth many days has lain; love lives again, that with the dead has been; love is come again like wheat arising green. 2 In the grave they laid him, love by hatred slain, thinking that he would never wake again, laid in the earth like grain that sleeps unseen; love is come again like wheat arising green. 3 Forth he came at Easter like the risen grain, he that for three days in the grave had lain; raised from the dead, my living Lord is seen; love is come again like wheat arising green. 4 When our hearts are wintry, grieving, or in pain, your touch can call us back to life again; fields of our hearts that dead and bare have been: love is come again like wheat arising green."

In our death, a resurrection; at the last, a victory, unrevealed until its season, something God alone can see. Informational Notes The writing of this hymn was spurred by a line from the poet T.S. Eliot: “In my end is my beginning.” Shortly after this piece was completed, the author/composer’s husband was diagnosed with what proved to be a terminal malignancy, and the original anthem version of this hymn was sung at his funeral.","1 In the bulb there is a flower; in the seed, an apple tree; in cocoons, a hidden promise: butterflies will soon be free!

Informational Notes This 20th-century text provides a helpful corrective to a long history of negative attitudes toward Thomas for failing to believe the other disciples’ report that Christ had risen. His fact-seeking “skeptic mind” sounds remarkably modern and makes him a more sympathetic figure.","These Things Did Thomas Count as Real 1 These things did Thomas count as real: the warmth of blood, the chill of steel, the grain of wood, the heft of stone, the last frail twitch of blood and bone. 2 The vision of his skeptic mind was keen enough to make him blind to any unexpected act too large for his small world of fact. 3 His reasoned certainties denied that one could live when one had died, until his fingers read like Braille the markings of the spear and nail. 4 May we, O God, by grace believe and thus the risen Christ receive, whose raw imprinted hands reached out and beckoned Thomas from his doubt."
257,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create The Risen Christ Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 The risen Christ, who walks on wounded feet from garden tomb through darkened city street, unlocks the door of grief, despair, and fear, and speaks a word of peace to all who hear. 2 The risen Christ, who stands with wounded side, breathes out his Spirit on them to abide whose faith still wavers, who dare not believe; new grace, new strength, new purpose they receive. 3 The risen Christ, who breaks with wounded hand the bread for those who fail to understand, reveals himself, despite their lingering tears, enflames their hearts, then quickly disappears. 4 May we, Christ's body, walk and serve and stand with the oppressed in this and every land, till all are blessed and can a blessing be, restored in Christ to true humanity. Informational Notes This perceptive hymn centers on Christ’s post-Resurrection appearances described in John 20:19–29 and Luke 24:13–48. The first three stanzas are shaped by the wounded body parts: feet, side, hand; the fourth prays for such woundedness in the witness of Christ’s body, the Church.","1 The risen Christ, who walks on wounded feet from garden tomb through darkened city street, unlocks the door of grief, despair, and fear, and speaks a word of peace to all who hear. 2 The risen Christ, who stands with wounded side, breathes out his Spirit on them to abide whose faith still wavers, who dare not believe; new grace, new strength, new purpose they receive. 3 The risen Christ, who breaks with wounded hand the bread for those who fail to understand, reveals himself, despite their lingering tears, enflames their hearts, then quickly disappears. 4 May we, Christ's body, walk and serve and stand with the oppressed in this and every land, till all are blessed and can a blessing be, restored in Christ to true humanity."
258,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create A Hymn of Glory Let Us Sing! Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 A hymn of glory let us sing! New songs throughout the world shall ring: Christ, by a road before untrod, ascends unto the throne of God. 2 The holy apostolic band upon the Mount of Olives stand, and with his followers they see their Lord ascend in majesty. 3 To all, the shining angels cry, ""Why stand and gaze upon the sky? This is the Savior!"" thus they say; ""this is his glorious triumph-day."" 4 ""You see him now, ascending high up to the portals of the sky. Hereafter you shall Jesus see returning in great majesty."" 5 O risen Christ, ascended Lord, all praise to you let earth accord. You are, while endless ages run, with Father and with Spirit one. Informational Notes These stanzas have been crafted from various English translations of a much longer Latin hymn preserved in an 11th-century manuscript in the British Museum. This text celebrating Christ’s majesty is well set to a 15th-century English tune commemorating a military victory.","1 A hymn of glory let us sing!

Informational Notes This rather telegraphic paraphrase of Psalm 29 effectively conveys the psalm’s recurring contrast between the mighty voice of God heard in thunder and tempest and the awestruck response of creation. Above this tumult, God reigns in peace, and the people of God sing praise.","1 The God of heaven thunders, whose voice in strident echoes resounds above the waters, and all the world sings, ""Glory, glory, glory!"" 2 The desert writhes in tempest; wind whips the trees to fury; the lightning splits the forest and flame diffuses glory, glory, glory! 3 The mighty God eternal is to the throne ascended, and we who are God's people, within these walls cry, ""Glory, glory, glory!"""

As within the veil you entered, robed in flesh, our great high priest; here on earth both priest and victim in the eucharistic feast. Informational Notes The author regarded this text as a communion hymn, a theme that seems eclipsed by the attention to Christ’s exaltation, but a helpful reminder that such hymns are not always quiet and meek. This text is sung to various tunes, but this rousing Welsh one is a favorite choice.","1 Alleluia! Sing to Jesus; his the scepter, his the throne; Alleluia! his the triumph, his the victory alone!

Rulers, peoples, now join to serve the Lord; for earth’s mighty ones all belong to God, who exalted reigns: now with psalms rejoice! Informational Notes In joining this 20th-century English paraphrase of Psalm 47—a psalm long associated with Christ’s Ascension--with the 16th-century Genevan psalm tune written for a French metrical version, an important affirmation of the continuity of Reformed tradition is being made.","1 Peoples, clap your hands!

Informational Notes Drawing on several passages in Hebrews (especially 4:14–16), this hymn celebrates the culmination of the Incarnation in Christ’s exaltation, a source of encouragement to all who trust in this “pioneer of our salvation” (Hebrews 2:10, 12:2) who continues to intercede for us.","1 Since our great high priest, Christ Jesus, bears the name above all names, reigning Son of God, surpassing other titles, powers, and claims; since to heaven our Lord has passed, let us hold our witness fast! 2 Since we have a priest who suffered, knowing weakness, tears, and pain, who, like us, was tried and tempted, unlike us, without a stain; since he shared our lowly place, let us boldly seek his grace. 3 Sacrifice and suffering over, now he sits at God's right hand, crowned with praise, no more an outcast, his preeminence long planned; such a great high priest we have, strong to help, supreme to save. 4 Love's example, hope's attraction, faith's beginning and its end, pioneer of our salvation, mighty advocate and friend: Jesus, high in glory raised, our ascended Lord, be praised!"

Informational Notes This 18th-century text celebrating the sovereignty of Christ has been through several expansions and contractions before reaching its present form. It is set here to the oldest American hymn tune in continuous use since first published in 1793, which was written for it.","1 All hail the power of Jesus' name!

Informational Notes This may well be a hymn based on a hymn, for scholars say that the passage behind it (Philippians 2:5–11), though not in the style of Greek poetry, shows traits of a communal creedal statement capable of being sung. It is set here to one of the composer’s most sonorous tunes.","1 At the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, every tongue confess him King of glory now; 'tis the Father's pleasure we should call him Lord, who from the beginning was the mighty Word. 2 Humbled for a season to receive a name from the lips of sinners unto whom he came, faithfully he bore it spotless to the last, brought it back victorious, when from death he passed; 3 Bore it up triumphant, with its human light, through all ranks of creatures, to the central height, to the throne of Godhead, to the Father's breast, filled it with the glory of that perfect rest. 4 Christians, this Lord Jesus shall return again, with his Father's glory o'er the earth to reign; for all wreaths of empire meet upon his brow, and our hearts confess him King of glory now."

Informational Notes This hymn is a classic example of how Isaac Watts Christianized the Psalms, in this case Psalm 72:5–19, by turning their messianic language to New Testament equivalents. The tune was at first nameless and anonymous, but is now called by the address of the supposed composer.","1 Jesus shall reign where'er the sun does its successive journeys run; his kingdom stretch from shore to shore, till moons shall wax and wane no more. 2 To him shall endless prayer be made, and praises throng to crown his head; his name, like sweet perfume, shall rise with every morning sacrifice. 3 People and realms of every tongue dwell on his love with sweetest song, and infant voices shall proclaim their early blessings on his name. 4 Blessings abound where'er he reigns: the prisoners leap to loose their chains; the weary find eternal rest, and all who suffer want are blest. 5 Let every creature rise and bring honors peculiar to our King; angels descend with songs again, and earth repeat the loud Amen!"

Informational Notes While Isaac Watts did not write this text strictly for Christmas use, he did purposely cast his paraphrase of Psalm 98:4–9 in Christian terms, titling it “The Messiah’s coming and kingdom.” So “the Lord” here is Jesus Christ, rather than the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.","1 Joy to the world, the Lord is come!

His reign shall know no end; and round his pierced feet fair flowers of paradise extend their fragrance ever sweet. 4 Crown him the Lord of years, the potentate of time; creator of the rolling spheres, ineffably sublime. All hail, Redeemer, hail! For thou hast died for me; thy praise shall never, never fail throughout eternity. Informational Notes This text is so familiar that it is easy to miss all its paradox, mystery, suffering, and beauty; it rewards careful reading and meditation outside corporate worship. The tune’s composer, chapel organist at Windsor Castle, had much experience in creating a royal sound.","1 Crown him with many crowns, the Lamb upon his throne; hark, how the heavenly anthem drowns all music but its own!

The crown awaits the conquest; lead on, O God of might! Informational Notes Not everything that looks like a battle ends up being one. This text, written for a seminary graduation, works well with its martial tune in the first stanza; but later stanzas turn from such imagery and focus on “deeds of love and mercy” and courage for life’s journey.","1 Lead on, O King eternal!

You, Lord, are greatly to be praised; your greatness is beyond our thought; all generations shall tell forth the mighty wonders you have wrought. 2 How rich in grace are you, O Lord, full of compassion, merciful, your anger always slow to rise; your steadfast love you show to all, for you are good in all your ways; your creatures know your constant care. To all your works your love extends; all souls your tender mercies share. 3 Your works will give you thanks, O Lord; your saints your mighty acts will show, till all the peoples of the earth your kingdom, power, glory know. Eternal is your kingdom, Lord, forever strong, forever sure; while generations rise and die, your high dominion will endure. Informational Notes Although this paraphrase of Psalm 145 is abbreviated (the original psalm has a verse for each letter of the Hebrew alphabet), it maintains the tone of praise that characterizes the final six psalms. In fact, the whole book takes its Hebrew name, Tehillim (praises), from them.","1 O Lord, you are my God and King, and I will ever bless your name; I will extol you every day, and evermore your praise proclaim. You, Lord, are greatly to be praised; your greatness is beyond our thought; all generations shall tell forth the mighty wonders you have wrought. 2 How rich in grace are you, O Lord, full of compassion, merciful, your anger always slow to rise; your steadfast love you show to all, for you are good in all your ways; your creatures know your constant care.

Informational Notes In Jewish practice Psalm 93, and other psalms sharing the same theme, acknowledged God’s sovereignty over all creation, especially over chaotic powers such as those of the raging sea. In Christian use this psalm and its paraphrases have been sung to celebrate the reign of Christ.","1 The Lord Almighty reigns in majesty most bright, appareled in omnipotence, and girded round with might. 2 The world established stands on its foundations broad; your throne is fixed, you reign supreme, the everlasting God. 3 The seas have lifted up their voice in majesty, but God on high, supreme in might, is greater than the sea. 4 Your testimonies, Lord, in faithfulness excel, and holy must your servants be who in your temple dwell."

Informational Notes Like other psalms celebrating God’s sovereignty, Psalm 93 has been applied in Christian practice to Christ’s ascension and reign. That connection is reinforced by setting this paraphrase to a Welsh tune linked with a text on the Crucifixion (the tune name means “Mount Calvary”).","1 God, you rule with royal bearing, clothed in glory, love, and light: you have robed yourself majestic, robed yourself with power and might.

Informational Notes This African American spiritual is a classic example of how praise of God rises out of human experience.

Mindful of the works of Søren Kierkegaard, she drafted it on a commuter bus after “a particularly bad day” of prison ministry.","1 You, Lord, are both Lamb and Shepherd.

Our helper he, amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing. For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe. His craft and power are great, and armed with cruel hate, on earth is not his equal. 2 Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing, were not the right man on our side, the man of God's own choosing. Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is he. Lord Sabaoth his name, from age to age the same, and he must win the battle. 3 And though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us, we will not fear, for God hath willed his truth to triumph through us. The Prince of Darkness grim, we tremble not for him. His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure. One little word shall fell him. 4 That word above all earthly powers, no thanks to them, abideth. The Spirit and the gifts are ours through him who with us sideth. Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also. The body they may kill; God's truth abideth still. His kingdom is forever. Informational Notes Long before Isaac Watts began to Christianize the Psalms, Martin Luther had already done so when he created the text and tune for this, his most famous hymn, which is based on Psalm 46. Luther encouraged metrical versions of psalms as well as chanted psalms and new hymns.","1 A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing. Our helper he, amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing. For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe. His craft and power are great, and armed with cruel hate, on earth is not his equal. 2 Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing, were not the right man on our side, the man of God's own choosing. Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is he. Lord Sabaoth his name, from age to age the same, and he must win the battle. 3 And though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us, we will not fear, for God hath willed his truth to triumph through us. The Prince of Darkness grim, we tremble not for him. His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure.

Refrain. 3 Glad my soul for I have seen the glory of the Lord. The trumpet sounds; the dead shall be raised. I know my Savior lives.  Refrain. Informational Notes This loose paraphrase effectively conveys the joyful tone of Psalm 98, largely by incorporating allusions to many other scriptures, such as Psalm 149:3, Romans 13:11, Psalm 16:9, 1 Corinthians 15:52 , and Job 19:25. These familiar echoes help to give the text depth and breadth.","Refrain: Sing a new song unto the Lord; let your song be sung from mountain’s high.

Informational Notes This 20th-century text was written by a Presbyterian layperson and poet, who in her later years became interested in writing hymns for the seasons of the church year and prepared a collection of them for her congregation. It pairs effectively with this sturdy Welsh tune.","1 Come, O Spirit, dwell among us; come with Pentecostal power; give the church a stronger vision; help us face each crucial hour.

Informational Notes 286	Breathe on Me, Breath of God

In both Hebrew and Greek, the words for “spirit” can equally well be translated as “breath” or “wind,” so it is very appropriate to address the Holy Spirit as the “Breath of God.”  This tune by an English organist has become the customary one in North American hymnals.","1 Breathe on me, Breath of God; fill me with life anew, that I may love what thou dost love, and do what thou wouldst do. 2 Breathe on me, Breath of God, until my heart is pure, until with thee I will one will, to do and to endure. 3 Breathe on me, Breath of God, till I am wholly thine, until this earthly part of me glows with thy fire divine. 4 Breathe on me, Breath of God, so shall I never die, but live with thee the perfect life of thine eternity."

Informational Notes This narrative and interpretive text was written to fill what the author perceived as an unfortunate gap in available hymns concerning the Holy Spirit in general and Pentecost in particular. The setting of a 17th-century German tune is from Mendelssohn’s oratorio Elijah.","1 On Pentecost they gathered quite early in the day, a band of Christ's disciples, to worship, sing, and pray.

As we seek the realm of God, we unite to pray: Jesus, Savior, guide our steps, for you are the Way. 2 Many are the tongues we speak, scattered are the lands; yet our hearts are one in God, one in love's demands. While in darkness hope appears, calling age and youth: Jesus, teacher, dwell with us, for you are the Truth. 3 Nature's secrets open wide, changes never cease; where, O where, can weary souls find the source of peace? Unto all those sore distressed, torn by endless strife: Jesus, healer, bring your balm, for you are the Life. 4 Grant, O God, an age renewed, filled with deathless love; help us as we work and pray; send us from above truth and courage, faith and power needed in our strife: Jesus, Savior, be our Way; be our Truth, our Life."

As once you chose to tell your love in human flesh and bone, so let our lives be used to make your saving purpose known. 2 Bless us for your service, Lord; no power we devise will ever give us strength enough or make us truly wise, yet by your promise we can know the peace your grace supplies. 3 Break us open to disclose how brokenness can heal, wherever broken loaves suffice to give a crowd a meal and graves break open to release new life from death’s dread seal. 4 Give us to the world you love as light and salt and yeast, that we may nourish in your name the last, the lost, the least, until at length you call us all to your unending feast. Informational Notes This Lord’s Supper text is organized around the fourfold liturgical shape traced by Dom Gregory Dix in The Shape of the Liturgy: take, bless, break, give. It considers how the phrase “Body of Christ,” used for sacramental bread, can also be applied to the baptized people of God.","1 Take us as we are, O God, and claim us as your own.

This sung prayer is notable as an affirmation of God’s active care for the once-gathered community while dispersed and of hope to be reunited.","1 Lord, make us more holy; Lord, make us more holy; Lord, make us more holy, until we meet again: holy, holy, holy, until we meet again. 2 Lord, make us more loving; Lord, make us more loving; Lord, make us more loving, until we meet again: loving, loving, loving, until we meet again. 3 Lord, make us more patient; Lord, make us more patient; Lord, make us more patient, until we meet again: patient, patient, patient, until we meet again. 4 Lord, make us more faithful; Lord, make us more faithful; Lord, make us more faithful, until we meet again: faithful, faithful, faithful, until we meet again."

(Refrain) Informational Notes By blending biblical images and current vignettes in the present tense, this hymn connects Christ’s promise that he is the Light of the world (John 8:12, 9:5) and his charge to his followers to be the light of the world (Matthew 5:14). This is part of the church’s servant calling.","1 Longing for light, we wait in darkness. Longing for truth, we turn to you. Make us your own, your holy people, light for the world to see.

As members of each body joined, in him we are made one. 3 Let strife among us be unknown; let all contentions cease. Be God’s the glory that we seek; be his our only peace. 4 Let us forgive each other’s faults as we our own confess, that we may love each other well in Christian gentleness. 5 Love can exclude no race or creed if honored be God’s name; our common life embraces all whose Maker is the same. Informational Notes This English paraphrase is based on a longer Latin hymn traditionally associated with the footwashing ritual on Maundy Thursday, an enactment of Christ’s “new commandment” that we should love one another (John 13:34). For a chant setting of the first line of the hymn see no. 205.","1 Where charity and love prevail, there God is ever found; brought here together by Christ’s love, by love we thus are bound. 2 Let us recall that in our midst dwells Christ, God’s holy Son.

This text formed a very small part of an elaborate Christian missionary pageant in the early 20th century, yet it has endured while the grander aspects of that production have faded away.

One holy name she blesses, partakes one holy food, and to one hope she presses, with every grace endued. 3 Though with a scornful wonder this world sees her oppressed, by schisms rent asunder, by heresies distressed, yet saints their watch are keeping; their cry goes up: ""How long?""

Lord, give us grace that we, like them, the meek and lowly, may live eternally. Informational Notes This hymn was one of twelve written by an English curate to affirm the articles of the Apostles’ Creed with biblical allusions such as 1 Corinthians 3:11 here. Though not created for this text, the tune was joined to it in 1868, and the two have been inseparable ever since.","1 The church's one foundation is Jesus Christ her Lord.

Our help is in the name of God the Lord. 3 Praise God the Lord who hears the captives’ prayer. Like birds escaping from the fowler’s snare we are set free; our praises now ascend: “Blessed be the Lord: Creator, Savior, Friend. Our help is in the name of God the Lord.” Informational Notes As a means of fostering the continuity of Reformed tradition, this paraphrase of Psalm 124 has been created to fit the tune that was used for the French paraphrase of Psalm 124 in the 1551 Genevan Psalter. The early psalters in English generally avoided such longer poetic forms.","1 Our help is in the name of God the Lord, the One who made the heavens with a word, creator of the world, each living thing. Come, bless the Lord, lift up your hearts and sing: “Our help is in the name of God the Lord.” 2 When evil seems to have the upper hand, call on God’s name: the Lord, the great “I am.” When troubles rise and all around gives way, remember God stays with us night and day.

331,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create God of the Ages, Whose Almighty Hand Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 God of the ages, whose almighty hand leads forth in beauty all the starry band of shining worlds in splendor through the skies, our grateful songs before thy throne arise. 2 Thy love divine hath led us in the past. In this free land by thee our lot is cast. Be thou our ruler, guardian, guide, and stay: thy word our law, thy paths our chosen way. 3 From war's alarms, from deadly pestilence, be thy strong arm our ever sure defense. Thy true religion in our hearts increase. Thy bounteous goodness nourish us in peace. 4 Refresh thy people on their toilsome way. Lead us from night to never-ending day. Fill all our lives with love and grace divine, and glory, laud, and praise be ever thine. Informational Notes This hymn was generated by 19th-century centennial celebrations: the words by the Declaration of Independence and the music by the adoption of the United States Constitution. Despite these origins, no specific nation is mentioned in this hymn of praise and prayer for peace.","1 God of the ages, whose almighty hand leads forth in beauty all the starry band of shining worlds in splendor through the skies, our grateful songs before thy throne arise. 2 Thy love divine hath led us in the past.

332,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create The Right Hand of God Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 The right hand of God is writing in our land, writing with power and with love; our conflicts and our fears, our triumphs and our tears, are recorded by the right hand of God. 2 The right hand of God is pointing in our land, pointing the way we must go; so clouded is the way, so easily we stray, but we’re guided by the right hand of God. 3 The right hand of God is striking in our land, striking out at envy, hate, and greed. Our selfishness and lust, our pride and deeds unjust, are destroyed by the right hand of God. 4 The right hand of God is healing in our land, healing broken bodies, minds, and souls; so wondrous is its touch with love that means so much, when we’re healed by the right hand of God. 5 The right hand of God is planting in our land, planting seeds of freedom, hope, and love; in these Caribbean lands, let people all join hands, and be one with the right hand of God. Informational Notes In biblical imagery, references to “the right hand of God” imply God’s power and God’s favor. Beginning with an allusion to the handwriting on the wall at Belshazzar’s feast (Daniel 5:5), this vigorous Caribbean hymn proceeds to identify ways God continues to act in our own day.","1 The right hand of God is writing in our land, writing with power and with love; our conflicts and our fears, our triumphs and our tears, are recorded by the right hand of God. 2 The right hand of God is pointing in our land, pointing the way we must go; so clouded is the way, so easily we stray, but we’re guided by the right hand of God. 3 The right hand of God is striking in our land, striking out at envy, hate, and greed.

333,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create How Our Hearts with Joy Abound Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 How our hearts with joy abound, with your beauty all around; words are feeble to express your great love and righteousness. 2 Fairer still than human frame, ever to our eyes the same, steadfast love shines from your face; from your lips flow words of grace. 3 Yours the scepter, yours the throne; you to us are God alone. Vast the mercies to us given: wealth of earth, and joy of heaven. Informational Notes Though it may have originated as a royal marriage ode, Psalm 45 has come to be understood in both Jewish and Christian traditions as having messianic overtones, and it is quoted that way in Hebrews 1:8–9. This 20th-century paraphrase skillfully maintains that double application.","1 How our hearts with joy abound, with your beauty all around; words are feeble to express your great love and righteousness. 2 Fairer still than human frame, ever to our eyes the same, steadfast love shines from your face; from your lips flow words of grace. 3 Yours the scepter, yours the throne; you to us are God alone. Vast the mercies to us given: wealth of earth, and joy of heaven."
334,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create With Grateful Heart My Thanks I Bring Added to Favorites ‹ › Lyrics 1 With grateful heart my thanks I bring; before the “gods” your praise I sing. I worship in your holy place and praise you for your truth and grace; for truth and grace together shine in your most holy Word divine. 2 I cried to you, and you did save; your word of grace new courage gave. The kings of earth shall thank you, Lord, for they have heard your wondrous word; yes, they shall come with songs of praise for great and glorious are your ways. 3 O Lord, enthroned in glory bright, you reign alone in heavenly height; the proud in vain your favor seek, but you have mercy for the meek. Through trouble though my pathway be, you will revive and strengthen me. 4 You will stretch forth your mighty arm to save me when my foes alarm. The work you have for me begun shall by your grace be fully done. Your love forever will endure: your mercy, Lord, is ever sure. Informational Notes Though Psalm 138 is usually regarded as a personal song of thanksgiving, this paraphrase makes clear that it also deals with the theme of God’s sovereignty over would-be deities and over all human rulers. The fourth stanza shows that the psalm looks forward as well as backward.","1 With grateful heart my thanks I bring; before the “gods” your praise I sing. I worship in your holy place and praise you for your truth and grace; for truth and grace together shine in your most holy Word divine. 2 I cried to you, and you did save; your word of grace new courage gave.

335,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create The Foolish in Their Hearts Deny Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 The foolish in their hearts deny the holy God who reigns: “There is no God! There is no God,” this generation claims. Our God looks down on humankind with penetrating eye to see if there are any wise who seek the Lord on high. 2 The Lord finds all have turned aside from doing what is right, that all have strayed, not one does good, not one within God’s sight. Have they no knowledge, who consume God’s own as they eat bread, who do not call upon the Lord, who will not bow their head? 3 But they will all be terrified, for God is on the throne. Though evil ones oppress the poor, you, Lord, will help your own. O Lord, send us deliverance; restore us; hear our voice. When Zion’s restoration comes, God’s people will rejoice. Informational Notes This text paraphrases Psalm 14 (later repeated as Psalm 53), an unusual psalm because it deals with a general social evil rather than recounting the psalmist’s own slight or affliction. Yet it ends on a note of confidence that God will vindicate the People of the Covenant.","1 The foolish in their hearts deny the holy God who reigns: “There is no God!

Sing praises to his name; he forgets not his own. 2 Beside us to guide us, our God with us joining, ordaining, maintaining his kingdom divine; so from the beginning the fight we were winning; thou, Lord, wast at our side; all glory be thine! 3 We all do extol thee, thou leader triumphant, and pray that thou still our defender wilt be. Let thy congregation escape tribulation; thy name be ever praised! O Lord, make us free! Informational Notes First published among songs celebrating the end of Spanish control of the Netherlands, this text’s blend of patriotism and piety has made if popular at (often ecumenical) Thanksgiving Day services. The tune is named for the Viennese arranger whose male chorus popularized it.","1 We gather together to ask the Lord's blessing; he chastens and hastens his will to make known; the wicked oppressing now cease from distressing.

Long may our land be bright with freedom's holy light; protect us by thy might, great God, our King. *Or “parents” Informational Notes This now-familiar patriotic song was written by a Baptist minister and received its first public performance at an Independence Day celebration by the Boston Sabbath School Union in 1831. It was written to replace a German patriotic text sung to the same tune.","1 My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing: land where my *fathers died, land of the pilgrims' pride, from every mountainside let freedom ring. 2 My native country, thee, land of the noble free, thy name I love; I love thy rocks and rills, thy woods and templed hills; my heart with rapture thrills like that above. 3 Let music swell the breeze, and ring from all the trees sweet freedom's song.

The combination proved immensely popular during World War I and afterwards.","1 O beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain, for purple mountain majesties above the fruited plain!

Let our rejoicing rise high as the listening skies; let it resound loud as the rolling sea. Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us; sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us. Facing the rising sun of our new day begun, let us march on, till victory is won. 2 Stony the road we trod, bitter the chastening rod, felt in the days when hope unborn had died. Yet, with a steady beat, have not our weary feet come to the place for which our parents sighed? We have come over a way that with tears has been watered; we have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered, out from the gloomy past, till now we stand at last where the white gleam of our bright star is cast. 3 God of our weary years, God of our silent tears, thou who hast brought us thus far on the way; thou who hast by thy might led us into the light, keep us forever in the path, we pray. Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met thee; lest, our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget thee; shadowed beneath thy hand may we forever stand, true to our God, true to our native land. Informational Notes Initially a poem for a school assembly at which Booker T. Washington spoke on Lincoln’s birthday in 1900, this text and tune have gained national recognition and devotion, not only within the African American community, but also among all who seek liberation from oppression.","1 Lift every voice and sing till earth and heaven ring, ring with the harmonies of liberty.

This is my home, the country where my heart is; here are my hopes, my dreams, my holy shrine; but other hearts in other lands are beating with hopes and dreams as true and high as mine. 2 My country’s skies are bluer than the ocean, and sunlight beams on cloverleaf and pine. But other lands have sunlight too, and clover, and skies are everywhere as blue as mine. So hear my song, O God of all the nations, a song of peace for their land and for mine. 3 This is my prayer, O Lord of all earth's kingdoms: thy kingdom come; on earth thy will be done. Let Christ be lifted up till all shall serve him, and hearts united learn to live as one. So hear my prayer, O God of all the nations: myself I give thee; let thy will be done. Informational Notes The first two stanzas of this hymn were written between the 20th century’s two world wars and focus on the theme of international peace. The third stanza, by another author and added later, uses the language of the Lord’s Prayer to voice a distinctly Christian perspective.","1 This is my song, O God of all the nations, a song of peace for lands afar and mine.

Let all the peoples praise you; let all the nations sing; in every land let praises and songs of gladness ring. 2 For you will judge the peoples in truth and righteousness, and on the earth all nations will your just rule confess. Let all the peoples praise you; let all the nations sing. Then earth in rich abundance to us its fruit will bring. The Lord our God will bless us; our God will blessing send, and all the earth will worship to its remotest end. Informational Notes As this paraphrase shows, Psalm 67 combines many themes: a communal prayer for blessing, a prayer for all people to acknowledge God, and thanksgiving for a bountiful harvest. In Jewish practice it was recited at the end of every Sabbath, a reminder of God’s universal sovereignty.","1 O God, show mercy to us, and bless us with your grace; and cause to shine upon us the brightness of your face, so that your way most holy on earth may soon be known, and unto every people your saving grace be shown.

Informational Notes More than a century after it was written, this plea for national purification has lost none of its power, nor has the need for social justice grown less acute. It is set to a traditional Welsh tune named for a long-inhabited town in north Wales overlooking the River Clywd.","1 Judge Eternal, throned in splendor, Lord of lords and King of kings, with your living fire of judgment purge this land of bitter things; solace all its wide dominion with the healing of your wings. 2 Still the weary folk are pining for the hour that brings release, and the city’s crowded clangor cries aloud for sin to cease, and the homesteads and the woodlands plead in silence for their peace. 3 Crown, O God, your own endeavor; cleave our darkness with your sword; feed the faithless and the hungry with the richness of your word; cleanse the body of this nation through the glory of the Lord."

Informational Notes 343	Where Cross the Crowded Ways of Life

Because dense populations always result in concentrated hardships, this vivid yet timeless evocation of urban need connects to our own day as well as to Jesus’ lament over Jerusalem (Matthew 23:37/Luke 13:34). This tune was the first used with this text and is now customary.","1 Where cross the crowded ways of life, where sound the cries of race and clan, above the noise of selfish strife, we hear your voice, O Son of Man. 2 In haunts of wretchedness and need, on shadowed thresholds fraught with fears, from paths where hide the lures of greed, we catch the vision of your tears. 3 From tender childhood's helplessness, from human grief and burdened toil, from famished souls, from sorrow's stress, your heart has never known recoil. 4 The cup of water given for you still holds the freshness of your grace; yet long these multitudes to view the sweet compassion of your face. 5 O Master, from the mountainside, make haste to heal these hearts of pain; among these restless throngs abide; O tread the city's streets again; 6 Till all the world shall learn your love, and follow where your feet have trod; till glorious from your heaven above shall come the city of our God."

Informational Notes 345	In an Age of Twisted Values

One of the ways Christians can show firm allegiance to the country where they live and express care for its well-being is to ensure that they are mindful of the broad range of human needs within that society. This hymn is a strong reminder of the values that need such attention.","1 In an age of twisted values we have lost the truth we need. In sophisticated language we have justified our greed.

The hymn continues by identifying some of the many ways we are called to share with God in this healing work.","1 For the healing of the nations, Lord, we pray with one accord; for a just and equal sharing of the things that earth affords; to a life of love in action help us rise and pledge our word. 2 Lead us forward into freedom; from despair your world release, that, redeemed from war and hatred, all may come and go in peace.

The flowering of English hymnody in the 19th century included the rediscovery, translation, and versification of ancient Christian hymns, such as this text from one of the earliest existing Christian liturgies. It is set here to an adaptation of a 17th-century French melody.","1 Let all mortal flesh keep silence, and with fear and trembling stand; ponder nothing earthly minded, for with blessing in his hand Christ our God to earth descendeth, our full homage to demand. 2 King of kings, yet born of Mary, as of old on earth he stood, Lord of lords, in human vesture, in the body and the blood, he will give to all the faithful his own self for heavenly food. 3 Rank on rank the host of heaven spreads its vanguard on the way, as the Light of light descendeth from the realms of endless day, that the powers of hell may vanish as the shadows clear away. 4 At his feet the six-winged seraph, cherubim, with sleepless eye, veil their faces to the presence, as with ceaseless voice they cry, “Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, Lord most high!”"

Come, Lord Jesus; come, Lord Jesus; come, Lord Jesus. Thou shalt reign, and thou alone! Informational Notes Despite unclear musical origins, the result here is a characteristic early Methodist hymn tune, notable for its breadth and range.  It effectively sets a text of similarly mixed sources, one that Charles Wesley regarded as related to “Thy kingdom come” in the Lord’s Prayer.","1 Lo, he comes with clouds descending, once for our salvation slain; thousand, thousand saints attending join to sing the glad refrain: Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

A Voice Astounds Us Added to Favorites ‹ › Lyrics 1 “Sleepers, wake!” A voice astounds us; the shout of rampart guards surrounds us: “Awake, Jerusalem, arise!” Midnight’s peace their cry has broken, their urgent summons clearly spoken: “The time has come, O maidens wise! Rise up, and give us light; the Bridegroom is in sight. Alleluia! Your lamps prepare and hasten there, that you the wedding feast may share.” 2 Zion hears the watchmen singing; her heart with joyful hope is springing; she wakes and hurries through the night. Forth he comes, her Bridegroom glorious in strength of grace, in truth victorious: her star is risen, her light grows bright. Now come, most worthy Lord, God’s Son, incarnate Word, Alleluia! We follow all and heed your call to come into the banquet hall. 3 Lamb of God, the heavens adore you; let saints and angels sing before you, as harps and cymbals swell the sound. Twelve great pearls, the city’s portals: through them we stream to join the immortals as we with joy your throne surround. No eye has known the sight, no ear heard such delight: Alleluia! Therefore we sing to greet our King; for ever let our praises ring. Informational Notes This text is based on the parable of the wise and foolish bridesmaids (Matthew 25:1–13), but contains allusions to many other New Testament passages. Because one person created both text and tune, they combine majestically to form what is often called “the king of chorales.”","1 “Sleepers, wake!” A voice astounds us; the shout of rampart guards surrounds us: “Awake, Jerusalem, arise!” Midnight’s peace their cry has broken, their urgent summons clearly spoken: “The time has come, O maidens wise!

Come today, our judge, our glory. Be its name “The Lord is there!"" Informational Notes This 20th-century text greatly enriches the neglected genre of urban hymns. The second stanza quotes John 9:4, the third stanza refers to Jesus weeping over Jerusalem (Matthew 23:37/Luke 13:34), and the final line cites the name given to Israel’s future holy city (Ezekiel 48:35).","1 All who love and serve your city, all who bear its daily stress, all who cry for peace and justice, all who curse and all who bless: 2 In your day of wealth and plenty, wasted work and wasted play, call to mind the word of Jesus, ""You must work while it is day."" 3 For all days are days of judgment, and the Lord is waiting still, drawing near a world that spurns him, offering peace from Calvary's hill. 4 Risen Lord, shall yet the city be the city of despair?

So let your face shine on us all; restore us as your own. O come; Lord, come; restore and save us now.

Even in the midst of feeling cut off from God, there remains a sense of confidence in God’s unfailing mercy.","1 O hear our cry, O Lord; now hear us as we pray.

Mute avenues of ruins will mark where once proud cities stood, but from destruction God will save the faithful, just, and good. 3 Rise up, O God, reclaim the power usurped by mortal pride; deflate the hollow pomp of those whom rank and titles hide. Let not the needy cry unheard, the suffering hope in vain; restore the fallen, bless the meek, till peace and justice reign.

Informational Notes This text uses imagery from Jeremiah 33:14–16 and Matthew 24:29–36/Mark 13:24–32/Luke 21:25–36.

Let earth rejoice! 2 God’s fire ignites the clouds with judgment swift and just; the evil find their deeds in vain; God’s foes are brought to dust.

(Refrain) 4 The radiance of God’s light beams joy into our days; now filled with God’s own peace and love, our hearts resound with praise. 	(Refrain) Informational Notes The theme of rejoicing that unites Psalm 97 is fittingly emphasized here by the refrain that ties together these four stanzas. Instead of the intimacy with God celebrated in other psalms, the primary concern here is to proclaim God’s power over all false gods that tempt us.","1 God reigns! Let earth rejoice!

Informational Notes This text and this tune occur in almost all English-language hymnals (though not always together). The transforming power of love motivates the unending praise of the life to come, and this fine Welsh tune (whose name means “delightful”) gives us a foretaste of endless song.","1 Love divine, all loves excelling, Joy of heaven, to earth come down, fix in us thy humble dwelling; all thy faithful mercies crown.

First the blade, and then the ear, then the full corn shall appear. Lord of harvest, grant that we wholesome grain and pure may be. 3 For the Lord our God shall come, and shall take the harvest home; from each field shall in that day all offenses purge away; give the angels charge at last in the fire the tares to cast, but the fruitful ears to store in God's garner evermore. 4 Even so, Lord, quickly come to thy final harvest home. Gather thou thy people in, free from sorrow, free from sin, there forever purified, in thy presence to abide: come, with all thine angels, come; raise the glorious harvest home! Informational Notes Despite its familiar Thanksgiving associations, the real concern of this text is to recall the harvest imagery Jesus used to describe the fulfillment of God’s sovereignty. The tune name commemorates the royal chapel where the composer was organist for forty-seven years.","1 Come, ye thankful people, come; raise the song of harvest home.

Ocean and mountain, stream, forest, and flower echo these praises and tell of God's power. 3 Ever ascending the song and the joy, ever descending the love from on high; blessing and honor and glory and praise: this is the theme of the hymns that we raise. 4 Give we the glory and praise to the Lamb; take we the robe and the harp and the palm; sing we the song of the Lamb that was slain, dying in weakness but rising to reign. Informational Notes Fittingly titled “The Song of the Lamb” by its author, this hymn is a paraphrase and expansion of Revelation 5:12. It is set here to a resonant French tune of a kind that flourished in the transition from the older chant style to the harmonies and rhythms of modern hymns.","1 Blessing and honor and glory and power, wisdom and riches and strength evermore, be to the Lamb who our battle has won, whose are the kingdom, the crown, and the throne. 2 Let all the heavens sound forth Jesus’ name; let all the earth sing his glory and fame.

This is my Father's world; I rest me in the thought of rocks and trees, of skies and seas, his hand the wonders wrought. 2 This is my Father's world. O, let me ne'er forget that though the wrong seems oft so strong, God is the ruler yet. This is my Father's world. The battle is not done: Jesus who died shall be satisfied, and earth and heaven be one. Informational Notes When pastor of a Presbyterian church in Lockport, New York, the author of this text referred to his morning walks as “going out to see my Father’s world.” The tune created for these words is based on an English melody the composer learned from his mother when he was a boy.","1 This is my Father's world, and to my listening ears all nature sings, and round me rings the music of the spheres.

Righteous, commanding, ever glorious, praises be sung that never cease: just is our God, whose truth victorious establishes the world in peace. Informational Notes This Genevan tune (created for Psalm 118 but also used for Psalm 98 in the 1562 edition of the Genevan Psalter) has worked successfully with several English texts. Here it sets a 20th-century paraphrase of Psalm 98 that owes much of its effectiveness to the author’s skill with multisyllabic words.","1 New songs of celebration render to God who has great wonders done; love sits enthroned in ageless splendor; come and adore the mighty One.

Tell all who mourn: outcasts belong, who perishes will rise. 5 O for a world preparing for God’s glorious reign of peace, where time and tears will be no more, and all but love will cease. Informational Notes Everything longed for in this text is a reminder of how far our present world is from what God wants. Yet this is not just wishful thinking; it is a call to action, a summons to participate in the fulfillment of God’s desire for all earth’s people to live in radical shalom.","1 O for a world where everyone respects each other’s ways, where love is lived and all is done with justice and with praise. 2 O for a world where goods are shared and misery relieved, where truth is spoken, children spared, equality achieved. 3 We welcome one world family and struggle with each choice that opens us to unity and gives our vision voice. 4 The poor are rich; the weak are strong; the foolish ones are wise.

Then enemies shall learn to love, all creatures find their true accord; the hope of peace shall be fulfilled, for all the earth shall know the Lord. Informational Notes This text on peace was created to offer non-nationalistic words for a popular British tune. The first stanza depicts pax, a mode of peace focused on ending conflict, and the second (based on Isaiah 11:6–9) describes shalom, the condition of living in harmony and mutual good will.","1 O day of peace that dimly shines through all our hopes and prayers and dreams, guide us to justice, truth, and love, delivered from our selfish schemes.

When will this new day start? We long for peace and comfort to reign within each heart. Yet not in our lives only, nor simply in our home: we pray that all creation will one day find shalom. 3 When wars of desolation and hate come to an end, when nation meets with nation and calls the other “friend,” still peace in all its fullness will only have begun: shalom for all creation begins with justice done. 4 That little child shall lead us to walk the chosen way, to share the peaceful kingdom, to greet God’s newborn day.

Come ye before him and rejoice. 2 Know that the Lord is God indeed; without our aid he did us make; we are his folk; he doth us feed, and for his sheep he doth us take. 3 O enter then his gates with praise; approach with joy his courts unto; praise, laud, and bless his name always, for it is seemly so to do. 4 For why? The Lord our God is good; his mercy is forever sure; his truth at all times firmly stood, and shall from age to age endure."

You are the rock of your people’s salvation to whom our jubilant praises belong. 2 Ruled by your might are the heights of the mountains; held in your hands are the depths of the earth. Yours is the sea, yours the land, for you made them, God above all gods, who gave us our birth. 3 We are your people, the sheep of your pasture; you are our Maker, and to you we pray. Gladly we kneel in obedience before you; great is the one whom we worship this day! 4 Now let us listen, for you speak among us; open our hearts to receive what you say. Peace be to all who remember your goodness, trust in your word, and rejoice in your way! Informational Notes Psalm 95, often called Venite from its first word in Latin, has long served as an opening canticle in the worship of Western Christianity. John Calvin found here two reasons to praise God: for sustaining the created world and for adopting the church into a gracious relationship.","1 Come, worship God, who is worthy of honor; enter God’s presence with thanks and a song! You are the rock of your people’s salvation to whom our jubilant praises belong. 2 Ruled by your might are the heights of the mountains; held in your hands are the depths of the earth.

Informational Notes This paraphrase of Psalm 150:6 gains much conviction by being set to an Israeli melody.  Similarly, the equivalence of the phrase “Praise the Lord” and the familiar word “Hallelujah” becomes especially obvious when the Hebrew version is heard in alternation with the English text.","Come and sing the praise of the Lord: sing hallelujah! Come and sing the praise of the Lord: sing hallelujah! Let all that lives, all that has breath, sing the praise of God, hallelujah! Let all that lives, all that has breath, sing the praise of God.

(Estribillo) Informational Notes The author/composer has incorporated elements of his Argentinian culture in this dynamic paraphrase of Psalm 118. In particular, the melodic patterns of the refrain are intended to suggest the way cowboys (gauchos) greet each other when they ride out to their work in the morning.","Refrain: This is the day; this is the day; this is the day that God has made! 1 Open, now, open the doorways of justice!

Some of that meaning can be grasped if this song is sung in parts, especially in the original Shona.","1 Jesus, we are here; Jesus, we are here; Jesus, we are here; we are here for you.

And thus on you, most glorious, a triple light was given. 3 On you, God's people, meeting, the Holy Scripture hear, Christ's living presence greeting, through bread and wine made near. New graces ever gaining from this our day of rest, we reach the rest remaining to spirits of the blest. Informational Notes In this text the first day of the week represents a threefold commemoration of Creation, Resurrection, and Pentecost—each an encounter with Trinitarian activity centered on one of the Three Persons. The tune name recalls the secular German song adapted for use with several hymns.","1 O day of rest and gladness, O day of joy and light, O balm for care and sadness, most beautiful, most bright; on you, the high and lowly, through ages joined in tune, sing ""Holy, holy, holy"" to the great God triune. 2 On you, at earth’s creation the light first had its birth; on you, for our salvation Christ rose from depths of earth; on you, our Lord victorious sent Spirit forth from heaven.

Informational Notes Although this ancient text has often been used at church dedications, the first stanza clearly refers to the people of God and the second to the place where they meet. The stately and soaring tune is aptly named for the edifice where the composer served as organist and is buried.","1 Christ is made the sure foundation, Christ the head and cornerstone, chosen of the Lord and precious, binding all the church in one; holy Zion's help forever, and our confidence alone. 2 To this temple, where we call you, come, O Lord of hosts, and stay; come, with all your loving-kindness; hear your people as we pray, and your fullest benediction shed within these walls today. 3 Here bestow on all your servants what they seek from you to gain; what they gain from you, forever with the blessed to retain; and hereafter in your glory evermore with you to reign. 4 Laud and honor to the Father, laud and honor to the Son, laud and honor to the Spirit, ever three and ever one: one in might and one in glory while unending ages run!"

Touch our lips and ears and heart; help us by your Spirit's pleading. Hear the cry your church now raises; hear, and bless our prayers and praises. Informational Notes Originally conceived to be sung before the sermon, this hymn assumes a congregation that assembles regularly, and it needs to be placed near the beginning rather than the end of worship. The simple repetitive tune reinforces the text’s sense of receptivity and expectation.","1 Blessed Jesus, at your word we have come again to hear you; let our thoughts and hearts be stirred and in glowing faith be near you.

Christ will call us home to heaven; at his table we’ll sit down. Christ will gird himself and serve us with sweet manna all around. Informational Notes This hymn comes out of the early 19th-century southern camp meeting experience, where believers were invited to pray for new converts, often likened to biblical characters such as Paul’s jailer (Philippians 1:12–13). As its name shows, the five-note tune was created for this text.","1 Brethren, we have met to worship and adore the Lord our God. Will you pray with all your power while we try to preach the word?

(Estribillo) Informational Notes This infectious song from Argentina paraphrases Psalm 133, with the intention of encouraging a sense of communion among the members of a congregation. The underlying dance/song form is the chamarrita, brought to South America in the 1800s by Portuguese settlers from the Azores.","Refrain: O look and wonder: how good it is! 1 How good it is when brothers dwell in peace with one another; it is like precious oil when running fresh on Aaron's beard.

It adapts the original theme of national unity through shared worship on Mount Zion into a celebration of the unity God grants to those who come together in one place for worship.","How very good and pleasant when we live in unity.

For the love of God’s own people I will labor and pray for you.  (Refrain) Informational Notes Psalm 122 is among the most joyful of the pilgrimage psalms, because it sings of finally reaching Jerusalem, the home of the Temple. This rejoicing spills over into prayers for peace inspired perhaps by the placename Jerusalem, from roots meaning “to establish peace” (shalom).","1 I rejoiced when I heard them say: “Let us go to the house of God.” And now our feet are standing in your gates, O Jerusalem!

Gather us in and hold us forever; gather us in and make us your own; gather us in, all peoples together, fire of love in our flesh and our bone. Informational Notes The “you/your” mentioned in every stanza is never identified, but this 1979 hymn is clearly a corporate prayer to God on behalf of the diverse congregation who have assembled for worship, longing to be transformed and used as God’s witnesses and for God’s purposes.","1 Here in this place the new light is streaming; now is the darkness vanished away; see in this space our fears and our dreamings brought here to you in the light of this day.

The sparrow finds a shelter, a place to build her nest; and so your temple calls us within its walls to rest. 2 In your blest courts to worship, O God, a single day is better than a thousand if I from you should stray. I'd rather keep the entrance and claim you as my Lord than revel in the riches the ways of sin afford. 3 A sun and shield forever are you, O Lord Most High; you shower us with blessings; no good will you deny. The saints, your grace receiving, from strength to strength shall go, and from their life shall rivers of blessing overflow. Informational Notes The author of this text, a Presbyterian minister and educator, was humming this tune as he began to create a paraphrase of Psalm 84 that would emphasize the beauty and peace of God’s house. The tune is named for the composer’s oldest sister, who was his first piano teacher.","1 How lovely, Lord, how lovely is your abiding place; my soul is longing, fainting, to feast upon your grace.

Here of life the fountain flows; here is balm for all our woes. Informational Notes In the first stanza “Zion” is not a general synonym for Jerusalem but a reference to the part of the city where the Temple stood. It prepares the way for the interior temple of the heart in stanza two. The pre-existing tune is by a prominent German Reformed hymnwriter.","1 Open now thy gates of beauty, Zion, let me enter there, where my soul in joyful duty waits for God who answers prayer; O how blessed is this place, filled with solace, light, and grace. 2 Gracious God, I come before thee; come thou also unto me; where we find thee and adore thee, there a heaven on earth must be; to my heart O enter thou; let it be thy temple now. 3 Speak, O Lord, and I will hear thee; let thy will be done indeed; may I undisturbed draw near thee, while thou dost thy people feed.

Walls and a roof, sheltering people, windows for light, an open door. Yet it becomes a body that lives when we are gathered here, and know our God is near. 2 Words from afar, stars that are falling. Sparks that are sown in us like seed: names for our God, dreams, signs, and wonders sent from the past are what we need. We in this place remember and speak again what we have heard: God’s free redeeming word. 3 And we accept bread at his table, broken and shared, a living sign. Here in this world, dying and living, we are each other’s bread and wine. This is the place where we can receive what we need to increase: God’s justice and God’s peace. Informational Notes This text by a 20th-century Jesuit beautifully captures the fundamental truth that “church” is not primarily the building but the people who come together in order to be nourished by Word and Table so that they may show forth Christ’s redeeming presence in the world.","1 What is this place, where we are meeting? Only a house, the earth its floor. Walls and a roof, sheltering people, windows for light, an open door. Yet it becomes a body that lives when we are gathered here, and know our God is near. 2 Words from afar, stars that are falling. Sparks that are sown in us like seed: names for our God, dreams, signs, and wonders sent from the past are what we need. We in this place remember and speak again what we have heard: God’s free redeeming word. 3 And we accept bread at his table, broken and shared, a living sign. Here in this world, dying and living, we are each other’s bread and wine. This is the place where we can receive what we need to increase: God’s justice and God’s peace."

Informational Notes The phrase “holy ground” resonates with the experience of Moses at the burning bush, where he had an encounter with God (Exodus 3:5; also quoted in the martyr Stephen’s sermon, Acts 7:33). The reference to angels may recall Jacob’s vision (Genesis 28 :12–17) or Hebrews 12:22.","We are standing on holy ground, and I know that there are angels all around; let us praise Jesus now; we are standing in his presence on holy ground."

She recalled that sense of “a sweet, sweet Spirit” when she sat down at her piano the next day.","1 There’s a sweet, sweet Spirit in this place, and I know that it’s the Spirit of the Lord; there are sweet expressions on each face, and I know they feel the presence of the Lord.

Informational Notes Despite multiple layers of translation and revision, this text embodies the mystical piety of one of the German Reformed Church’s greatest hymnists and spiritual leaders of the early 18th century. It is set here to a slightly earlier tune from that tradition.","1 God, reveal your presence: gladly we adore you, and with awe appear before you.

All those who do such things shall live and safe from harm remain.

Combining elements from different eras testifies to the continuity of Reformed tradition.","1 Lord, to you my soul is lifted.

The first verse here centers on positive actions, the second on avoidance of negative actions, and the third on providing an improved spiritual condition.","1 Create in me a clean heart, O God; create in me a clean heart, O God; create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. 2 Cast me not away from your presence; cast me not away from your presence; cast me not away from your presence and take not your Holy Spirit from me. 3 Restore to me the joy of your salvation; restore to me the joy of your salvation; restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with your free Spirit."

Their traditional melody further connects us with these people on the other side of the world.","1 Son of God, whose heart is peace, Son of God, most holy, to your presence we have come; give us now your love. 2 Take away our sinfulness, evil that imprisons us; free us from what troubles us; give our souls release. 3 Warm our hearts to love you, Lord, you who died to save us; gather us within your arms, Jesus, on this day."

Informational Notes As this text acknowledges, the sins that separate us from God and from each other can be both things done and things left undone, as well as attitudes and habits that keep us from living in harmony. Letting go of our self-sufficiency enables us to receive Christ’s gracious gifts.","1 Before I take the body of my Lord, before I share his life in bread and wine, I recognize the sorry things within: these I lay down. 2 The words of hope I often failed to give, the prayers of kindness buried by my pride, the signs of care I argued out of sight: these I lay down. 3 The narrowness of vision and of mind, the need for other folk to serve my will, and every word and silence meant to hurt: these I lay down. 4 Of those around in whom I meet my Lord, I ask their pardon and I grant them mine, that every contradiction of Christ's peace might be laid down. 5 Lord Jesus Christ, companion at this feast, I empty now my heart and stretch my hands, and ask to meet you here in bread and wine which you lay down."

Let my praise and worship start with the cleansing of my heart. 2 Save me from the soothing sin of the empty cultic deed and the pious, babbling din of the claimed but unlived creed. Let my actions, Lord, express what my tongue and lips profess. 3 When I bend upon my knees, clasp my hands, or bow my head, let my spoken, public pleas be directly, simply said, free of tangled words that mask what my soul would plainly ask. 4 When I dance or chant your praise, when I sing a psalm or hymn, when I preach your loving ways, let my heart add its Amen. Let each cherished outward rite thus reflect your inward light. Informational Notes This prayerful text is based on Mark 7:1–8,14–15,21–23, where Jesus teaches that external religious observances are much less important than purity of heart. The tune was composed at the same time as part of a collaborative effort to create new hymns for a seminary community.","1 As a chalice cast of gold, burnished, bright and brimmed with wine, make me, Lord, as fit to hold grace and truth and love divine.

Informational Notes This paraphrase of selected verses from Psalm 79 distills the tone of communal lament that runs through that psalm. Because the sense of shame and the longing for restoration extend to the whole community, this psalm is usually associated with the Jewish exile in Babylon.","1 Remember not, O God, the sins of long ago; in tender mercy visit us, distressed and humbled low. 2 O Lord, our Savior, help, and glorify your name; deliver us from all our sins and take away our shame. 3 Then, safe within your fold, we will exalt your name; our thankful hearts with songs of joy your goodness will proclaim."

Informational Notes This reflection on Christian vocation was written to provide a new text for a pre-existing tune, and the poet has crafted his words so well that the two parts mesh smoothly. The tune is named for a noted British boarding school, whose music director was a friend of the composer.","1 How clear is our vocation, Lord, when once we heed your call to live according to your word and daily learn, refreshed, restored, that you are Lord of all and will not let us fall. 2 But if, forgetful, we should find your yoke is hard to bear; if worldly pressures fray the mind and love itself cannot unwind its tangled skein of care: our inward life repair. 3 We marvel how your saints became in hindrances more sure: whose joyful virtues put to shame the casual way we wear your name, and by our faults obscure your power to cleanse and cure. 4 In what you give us, Lord, to do, together or alone, in old routines or ventures new, may we not cease to look to you: the cross you hung upon, all you endeavored, done."

The first three stanzas address one of the three divine Persons, while the fourth stanza implores the help of the full Trinity.","1 Restore in us, O God, the splendor of your love; renew your image in our hearts, and all our sins remove. 2 O Spirit, wake in us the wonder of your power; from fruitless fear unfurl our lives like springtime bud and flower. 3 Bring us, O Christ, to share the fullness of your joy; baptize us in the risen life that death cannot destroy. 4 Three-personed God, fulfill the promise of your grace, that we, when all our searching ends, may see you face to face."
435,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create There's a Wideness in God's Mercy Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 There's a wideness in God's mercy, like the wideness of the sea. There's a kindness in God's justice, which is more than liberty. There is no place where earth's sorrows are more felt than up in heaven. There is no place where earth's failings have such kindly judgment given. 2 For the love of God is broader than the measures of the mind. And the heart of the Eternal is most wonderfully kind. If our love were but more faithful, we would gladly trust God's Word, and our lives reflect thanksgiving for the goodness of our Lord. Informational Notes These stanzas, excerpted from a quite a few more, offer a reminder that the model for our dealings with others should be God’s generosity rather than limited human tolerance. The text is effectively set to a broad and sturdy Dutch folk melody, probably from the 17th century.","1 There's a wideness in God's mercy, like the wideness of the sea.

The confidence of the text is well matched by its sturdy 17th-century French tune.","1 God of compassion, in mercy befriend us, giver of grace for our needs all-availing.

Could my zeal no respite know, could my tears forever flow, all for sin could not atone.

Informational Notes Though scholars discredit the story that this hymn was written when the author found shelter under a large rock during a thunderstorm, the popular appeal of that conjecture perhaps lies in the energy of this plea and the vividness of its imagery drawn from many biblical sources.","1 Rock of Ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee.

The opening line of stanza two, for example, draws on the root meaning of the Greek word for sin, and the beginning of stanza three alludes to John 8:3–8.","1 God, how can we forgive when bonds of love are torn? How can we rise and start anew, our trust reborn? When human loving fails and every hope is gone, your love gives strength beyond our own to face the dawn. 2 When we have missed the mark, and tears of anguish flow, how can you still release our guilt, the debt we owe? The ocean depth of grace surpasses all our needs. A priest who shares our human pain, Christ intercedes. 3 Who dares to throw the stone to damn another's sin, when you, while knowing all our past, forgive again? No more we play the judge, for by your grace we live. As you, O God, forgive our sin, may we forgive."

Blest, those to whom our Lord God will not impute their sin: whose guilt has been forgiven; whose hearts, made true again. 2 While I kept guilty silence, my strength was spent with grief. Your hand was heavy on me; my life found no relief. But when I made confession and hid no sin from you, when I revealed my failings, you gave me life anew. 3 So let the godly seek you, when troubling times are near; no storm or flood shall reach them, nor cause their hearts to fear. In you, O Lord, I hide me; you save me from all ill. And songs of your salvation my heart with rapture fill. Informational Notes Although this is one of the traditional seven penitential psalms, it could equally well be called a psalm of thanksgiving for forgiveness. It bears witness to the desirability of confession as well as to God’s gracious and forgiving nature, encouraging the faithful to seek God.","1 How blest, those whose transgressions have freely been forgiven; whose guilt is wholly covered before the sight of heaven.

Informational Notes This paraphrase of the latter part of Psalm 85 includes some remarkable signs of God’s reign: that mercy, truth, justice, and peace exist simultaneously and that the fruits of creation will be abundant. Because we still await that day, this psalm is often associated with Advent.","1 Show us, O Lord, your steadfast love, and let your saving grace be near; when we return with open hearts the Lord speaks peace and we will hear. 2 Mercy and truth at last have met; justice and peace are reconciled.

Informational Notes It seems odd now to think of singing this text to ADESTE FIDELIS, but mainline churches did so well into the 20th century because of a cultural bias against shape note music.

Teach me some melodious sonnet, sung by flaming tongues above; praise the mount! I’m fixed upon it, mount of God’s unchanging love! 2 Here I raise my Ebenezer; hither by thy help I’m come; and I hope, by thy good pleasure, safely to arrive at home. Jesus sought me when a stranger, wandering from the fold of God; he, to rescue me from danger, interposed his precious blood. 3 O to grace how great a debtor daily I’m constrained to be! Let that grace now, like a fetter, bind my wandering heart to thee. Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, prone to leave the God I love; here’s my heart; O take and seal it; seal it for thy courts above. Informational Notes Written for Pentecost by a British Baptist pastor, this text is full of biblical terms like “Ebenezer” (1 Samuel 7:12), Hebrew for “a stone of help” set up to give thanks for God’s assistance. The tune name honors hymnal compiler Asahel Nettleton, who probably did not compose it.","1 Come, thou Fount of every blessing; tune my heart to sing thy grace; streams of mercy, never ceasing, call for songs of loudest praise.

Wellspring, Source of life eternal, drench our dryness; make us whole. Informational Notes Like the Thanksgiving Over the Water in the rite of Baptism, this text by a United Church of Canada minister recalls significant events in salvation history involving water. The final stanza is a prayer to Christ, the Living Water (John 4:10, 14), to quench our spiritual thirst.","1 Crashing waters at creation, ordered by the Spirit's breath, first to witness day's beginning from the brightness of night's death. 2 Parting water stood and trembled as the captives passed on through, washing off the chains of bondage: channel to a life made new. 3 Cleansing water once at Jordan closed around the One foretold, opened to reveal the glory ever new and ever old. 4 Living water, never ending, quench the thirst and flood the soul.

Since thou art ever kind, beneath the shadow of thy wings we may a refuge find. 3 With the abundance of thy house we shall be satisfied; from rivers of unfailing joy our thirst shall be supplied. 4 The fountain of eternal life is found alone with thee. And in the brightness of thy light we clearly light shall see. 5 From those that know thee, may thy love and mercy ne'er depart, and may thy justice still protect and bless the upright heart. Informational Notes These five stanzas celebrating God’s merciful care for all creation correspond to Psalm 36:5–10 and were prepared by a joint committee of nine North American churches in the Reformed tradition. They are set here to a simple but memorable tune from the mid-16th century.","Thy Mercy and Thy Truth, O Lord (Psalm 36) 1 Thy mercy and thy truth, O Lord, transcend the lofty sky; thy judgments are a mighty deep, and as the mountains high. 2 Lord, all thy creatures thou wilt save.

My constant weeping brings no help; Lord, hear and answer me. In full assurance of your grace I turn to you in prayer. Deliver me from surging floods; draw near; reach out in care. 2 Your steadfast mercy, Lord, is good; hide not your face from me. Hear my distress and answer, Lord; make haste and set me free. You know of my reproach and shame; my heart despairs from grief. I looked for pity, but I found no comfort or relief. 3 Though I am poor and sorrowful, O Lord, attend my cry. Let your salvation come to me, and lift me up on high. Let heaven and earth and seas rejoice; let all that move give praise. All those that love God’s name shall live in Zion all their days. Informational Notes Because Hebrew thought identified large, uncontrolled bodies of water with chaos, this flood imagery is an effective way to express overwhelming distress. In Christian practice Psalm 69 has been second only to Psalm 22 in its use as a foreshadowing of the sufferings of Christ.","1 Save me, O God; I sink in floods, plunged into misery. My constant weeping brings no help; Lord, hear and answer me. In full assurance of your grace I turn to you in prayer.

Informational Notes This text is a 21st-century metrical paraphrase of the Apostles’ Creed (in the manner of Calvin’s Strasbourg liturgy). Its connections with Reformed tradition are further strengthened by being set to the tune created for Psalm 42 in the 1551 Genevan Psalter (see also no. 87).","1 I believe in God the Father, merciful and mighty Lord, maker of the earth and heavens, whom we worship and adore; and in Jesus Christ the Son, only Savior, sovereign one, by the Holy Spirit given, born of Mary, blessed virgin. 2 Under Pilate, Jesus suffered, faithful to his final breath.

Informational Notes Each stanza of this compact and carefully constructed text about baptism begins with allusions to John 3:5 and Ephesians 1:13.

If you find someone to share your time and you join your hearts as one, I’ll be there to make your verses rhyme from dusk till rising sun.” 3 “In the middle ages of your life, not too old, no longer young, I’ll be there to guide you through the night, complete what I’ve begun. When the evening gently closes in and you shut your weary eyes, I’ll be there as I have always been with just one more surprise.” 4 “I was there to hear your borning cry; I’ll be there when you are old. I rejoiced the day you were baptized to see your life unfold.”"

Power of water and God’s naming, turning us from dark to light, joins us to those who, before us, ran the race and fought the fight. 3 Death has no dominion o’er him, so for us death holds no power; life’s own waters now have marked us, born to God this very hour. From this moment and forever dead to sin, alive in Christ, born of water and the Spirit, now in Christ we find our life. Informational Notes Opening with an allusion to Galatians 3:28 and closing with one to John 3:5, this text is filled with specific scriptural phrases related to baptism. It also includes larger themes like the parallels with the deliverance of Israel from slavery through the waters of the Red Sea.","1 Now there is no male or female; now there is no free or slave; now there is no Jew or Gentile in the earth Christ died to save.

O chase the night of sin away; shed o'er the world thy holy light. Informational Notes This 19th-century American translation of stanzas from a longer Latin poem is so well shaped that it sounds like an original meditation on Christian experience centered on the Lord’s Supper. The North American tune name seems not to have originated with the English composer.","1 Jesus, thou joy of loving hearts, thou fount of life, thou light of all, from the best bliss that earth imparts we turn, unfilled, to heed thy call. 2 Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood; thou savest those that on thee call; to them that seek thee thou art good, to them that find thee, all in all. 3 We taste thee, O thou living bread, and long to feast upon thee still; we drink of thee, the fountainhead, and thirst our souls from thee to fill. 4 Our restless spirits yearn for thee, where'er our changeful lot is cast, glad when thy gracious smile we see, blest when our faith can hold thee fast. 5 O Jesus, ever with us stay; make all our moments calm and bright.

Informational Notes 495	Thee We Adore, O Hidden Savior, Thee

Originally conceived as a private prayer of preparation and set out in seven four-line stanzas in Latin, this text has been the inspiration for many English hymn versions, including this one by an English bishop. The fairly late plainsong tune moves toward modern tonalities.","Thee We Adore, O Hidden Savior, Thee 1 Thee we adore, O hidden Savior, thee, who at this blessed feast art pleased to be; both flesh and spirit in thy presence fail, yet here thy presence we devoutly hail. 2 O blest memorial of our dying Lord, who living bread to all doth here afford!

'Tis thy wounds our healing give; to thy cross we look and live. Thou our life! O let us be rooted, grafted, built on thee. Informational Notes Both the names used to address Christ in this eucharistic hymn appear only in the Fourth Gospel. Jesus refers to himself as the Bread of Heaven in John 6:51 and as the True Vine in John 15:1. The text is set to a tune with diverse roots, Welsh and French, sacred and secular.","1 Bread of heaven, on thee we feed, for thou art our food indeed.

Then the refrain text was written to fit that music, followed by stanzas based on themes from John 6. Finally, a melody for the stanzas was composed in the style of the refrain.","Refrain: Bread of life from heaven, your blood and body given, we eat this bread and drink this cup until you come again. 1 Break now the bread of Christ’s sacrifice; giving thanks, hungry ones, gather round.

By your body broken for us, by your wine of life outpoured, Jesus, feed again your people. Be our Host, our Life, our Lord. Informational Notes The first two stanzas of this text deal with events in the past (the feeding of the multitude and the Last Supper) and the final two with events in the present. The recurring last four lines of each stanza serve as an affirmation of Christ’s continuing presence at all times.","1 Loaves were broken, words were spoken by the Galilean shore.

Informational Notes This prayer-text divides into distinct halves, the first four lines being an extended address to Christ, and the last four being a series of petitions. These carefully crafted words are set to one of the most majestic tunes to emerge from the tradition of Reformed psalmody.","Bread of the world in mercy broken, Wine of the soul in mercy shed, by whom the words of life were spoken, and in whose death our sins are dead: look on the heart by sorrow broken; look on the tears by sinners shed; so may your feast become the token that by your grace our souls are fed."

Informational Notes Not all communion texts refer to the Last Supper: this brief hymn is based on the meal at Emmaus shared by the Risen Christ and his two companions on the road (Luke 24:13–35). It is set to a 16th-century psalm tune that carries the text with appropriate simplicity.","Be Known to Us in Breaking Bread 1 Be known to us in breaking bread, but do not then depart; Savior, abide with us, and spread your table in our heart. 2 Here share with us, in love divine, your body and your blood, that living bread, that heavenly wine be our immortal food."

Not many Lord’s Supper hymns call attention to the post-Resurrection meals Christ shared with his disciples, but the first stanza here alludes to the meal at Emmaus, when he was made known in the breaking of the bread (Luke 24:13–35), and stanza three refers to “the risen Christ.”","Feed us, Lord.

Life is overflowing when he breaks the bread. 2 We were lost in night, but you sought and found us. Give us strength to fight; death is all around us. Jesus, be our light. 3 He became our bread; Jesus died to save us. On him we are fed, eating what he gave us, rising from the dead. 4 Let us share the pain you endured in dying; we shall then remain living; death defying, we shall rise again. 5 Jesus, you were dead, but you rose and, living, made yourself our bread, in your goodness giving life though we were dead. 6 This is your design; in this meal we meet you. Be our bread and wine, Jesus, we entreat you. This shall be our sign. Informational Notes This 20th-century Dutch hymn could well be understood as an expansion of the imagery of death and life in Romans 6:1–11, interpreted from a eucharistic perspective. Such short lines and exact rhymes are a challenge to maintain; the art of this text is a measure of its conviction.","1 We who once were dead now live, fully knowing Jesus as our head.

Informational Notes St. Augustine spoke of eucharist as “the repeatable part of baptism,” and this hymn reminds us that each time we share in the Lord’s Supper we are renewing our baptismal vows. The text is set to a tune that dates to the transition between plainchant and modern tonalities.","1 Lord, we have come at your own invitation, chosen by you, to be counted your friends; yours is the strength that sustains dedication; ours, a commitment we know never ends. 2 Here, at your table, confirm our intention; give it your seal of forgiveness and grace; teach us to serve without pride or pretension, Lord, in your kingdom, whatever our place. 3 When, at your table, each time of returning, vows are renewed and our courage restored, may we increasingly glory in learning all that it means to accept you as Lord."

Informational Notes Without attempting to unravel the mystery of Christ’s presence in the bread and wine, the central stanza of this text affirms that we are nourished by faith rather than by understanding. This hopeful text is reinforced by a gentle 16th-century tune created for a secular text.","1 We come as guests invited when Jesus bids us dine, his friends on earth united to share the bread and wine; the bread of life is broken; the wine is freely poured for us, in solemn token of Christ our dying Lord. 2 We eat and drink, receiving from Christ the grace we need, and in our hearts believing on him by faith we feed; with wonder and thanksgiving for love that knows no end, we find in Jesus living our ever-present friend. 3 One bread is ours for sharing, one single fruitful vine, our fellowship declaring renewed in bread and wine: renewed, sustained, and given by token, sign, and word, the pledge and seal of heaven, the love of Christ our Lord."

There is room for everyone. 2 Clouds of light surround the table; ancient followers appear, saints confessing how they wrestled with their guilt, their doubt and fear. Peter tells of his denying Christ was ever in his sight; Paul relates his fruitless efforts to obliterate the light. 3 Their sad stories are repeated in a thousand different ways, but they share one thing in common: they all end in thanks and praise for the host who has invited north and south and east and west to converge around this table, where all life is fed and blest. 4 Bring your joy and bring your sadness, and prepare to be surprised by the host whose hands are wounded, who will open wide your eyes when he blesses bread and breaks it— truth and manna from above!— and then passes wine that wakens in your heart the taste of love. Informational Notes This text celebrates the radical hospitality that characterizes Christ’s welcome, which transcends time and reaches in all directions (Matthew 8:11/Luke13:29).  Saints of old are, like us, people in need of forgiveness, and the response to such pardon is “thanks and praise.”","1 Look who gathers at Christ’s table! Hear the stories that they bring.

Taste and see that God is good. 2 All who hunger, never strangers, seeker, be a welcome guest. Come from restlessness and roaming. Here, in joy, we keep the feast. We that once were lost and scattered in communion's love have stood. Taste and see the grace eternal. Taste and see that God is good. 3 All who hunger, sing together; Jesus Christ is living bread. Come from loneliness and longing. Here, in peace, we have been led. Blest are those who from this table live their days in gratitude. Taste and see the grace eternal. Taste and see that God is good."

No one is a stranger here; everyone belongs. Finding our forgiveness here, we in turn forgive all wrongs. 2 He joins us here; he breaks the bread; the Lord who pours the cup is risen from the dead; the one we love the most is now our gracious host: come, take the bread; come, drink the wine; come, share the Lord. We are now a family, of which the Lord is head. Though unseen, he meets us here in the breaking of the bread. 3 We’ll gather soon where angels sing; we’ll see the glory of our Lord and coming King; now we anticipate the feast for which we wait: come, take the bread; come drink the wine; come, share the Lord. Informational Notes The center of this text recalls Christ’s post-Resurrection meal at Emmaus (Luke 24:13–35), a reminder that the Risen Christ is in our midst when two or three gather in his name (Matthew 18:20) and share a foretaste of the Heavenly Feast (Matthew 26:29/Luke 22:18/Mark 14:25).","1 We gather here in Jesus’ name; his love is burning in our hearts like living flame; for through the loving Son the Father makes us one: come, take the bread; come, drink the wine; come, share the Lord.

Informational Notes Though rightly viewed as a meal of remembrance, the Lord’s Supper is also an occasion of anticipation. This text draws on abundant biblical imagery to evoke the fulfillment of Jesus’ promise to share the feast anew “in the kingdom of God” (Matthew 26:29/Mark 14:25/Luke 22:16).","1 Come, behold! the feast of heaven Alleluia! has to mortal flesh been given.

Come in; sit down; there's room at the table; enjoy the feast love has spread for you. Informational Notes There are many dimensions to the celebration of the Lord’s Supper, and this song focuses on the important theme of hospitality, with reference to Jesus’ table ministry and his teaching about the reversal of social distinctions (Matthew 19:30/Mark 10:31/Luke 13:30/Matthew 20:16).","The bread and the wine are here; (The feast is here.) come now, all who hunger and thirst.

The stanzas are derived from several passages in Revelation (5:9–10, 12–14; 7:10b, 12), while the refrain possibly refers to 1 Corinthians 15:54b–56.","Refrain: This is the feast of victory for our God.

Come into the daylight’s splendor; there with joy your praises render. Bless the one whose grace unbounded this amazing banquet founded; Christ, though heavenly, high, and holy, deigns to dwell with you most lowly. 2 Sun, who all my life does brighten; light, who does my soul enlighten; joy, your wondrous gift bestowing; fount, from which all good is flowing: at your feet I cry, my Maker, let me be a fit partaker of this blessed food from heaven, for our good, your glory given. 3 Jesus, source of lasting pleasure, truest friend and dearest treasure, peace beyond all understanding, joy into all life expanding: humbly now, I bow before you, love incarnate, I adore you; worthily let me receive you and, so favored, never leave you. Informational Notes Although the celebration of the Lord’s Supper is a solemn occasion, it is not a sad or somber one, but one evoking a deep joy. That tone also characterizes this chorale setting created for the original German text and notable for its support of the numerous two-syllable rhymes.","1 Soul, adorn yourself with gladness; leave the gloomy haunts of sadness.

The love that made us, makes us one, and strangers now are friends, and strangers now are friends. 4 The Spirit of the risen Christ, unseen, but ever near, is in such friendship better known, alive among us here, alive among us here. 5 Together met, together bound by all that God has done, we’ll go with joy, to give the world the love that makes us one, the love that makes us one. Informational Notes This text affirms that Christian unity is not achievement but gift, one renewed each time we gather for the Lord’s Supper. Each of us enters as an “I” and leaves as part of “we.” The unadorned language of this text is well matched to the simple shape note tune that sets it here.","1 I come with joy, a child of God, forgiven, loved, and free, the life of Jesus to recall, in love laid down for me, in love laid down for me. 2 I come with Christians far and near to find, as all are fed, the new community of love in Christ’s communion bread, in Christ’s communion bread. 3 As Christ breaks bread and bids us share, each proud division ends.

Informational Notes The author of this text, the editor of several Presbyterian hymnals, was the foremost American hymnologist of the early 20th century. Although some of his language in this text echoes early hymns of the church, he is writing here not as a scholar but as a person of deep faith.","For the Bread Which You Have Broken 1 For the bread which you have broken, for the wine which you have poured, for the words which you have spoken, now we give you thanks, O Lord. 2 By this promise that you love us, by your gift of peace restored, by your call to heaven above us, hallow all our lives, O Lord. 3 With the saints who now adore you seated at the heavenly board, may the church still waiting for you keep love's tie unbroken, Lord. 4 In your service, Lord, defend us; in our hearts keep watch and ward; in the world to which you send us let your kingdom come, O Lord."

Here would we touch and handle things unseen, here grasp with firmer hand eternal grace, and all our weariness upon you lean. 2 Here would we feed upon the bread of God, here drink with you the royal cup of heaven; here would we lay aside each earthly load, and taste afresh the calm of sin forgiven. 3 This is the hour of banquet and of song; this is the heavenly table for us spread. Here let us feast and, feasting, still prolong the fellowship of living wine and bread. 4 Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear. The feast, though not the love, is past and gone; the bread and wine remove, but you are here, nearer than ever, still our shield and sun. 5 Feast after feast thus comes and passes by, yet, passing, points to that glad feast above, giving sweet foretaste of the festal joy, the Lamb's great bridal feast of bliss and love. Informational Notes These stanzas are selected from a ten-stanza hymn written in 1885 to serve as a monthly post-communion reflection for the members of St. Andrew’s Free Church, Greenock, Scotland. They are set to a tune named for both a coastal town and a large bay in northwest England.","Here, O Our Lord, We See You 1 Here, O our Lord, we see you face to face.

Refrain: O Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God, I love the holy Lamb of God! O wash me in his precious blood, my Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God. 2 Your gift of love, we crucified; we laughed and scorned him as he died; the humble King we named a fraud and sacrificed the Lamb of God.	(Refrain) 3 I was so lost, I should have died, but you have brought me to your side to be led by your staff and rod, and to be called a lamb of God.	(Refrain) Informational Notes John the Baptist calls Jesus “the Lamb of God” when he sees Jesus coming for baptism at the Jordan river (John 1:29, 36). Sacrificial lamb references appear in Acts 8:32 (quoting Isaiah 53:7) and 1 Peter 1:19 as well as in twenty-eight triumphant “Lamb” mentions in Revelation.","1 Your only Son, no sin to hide, but you have sent him from your side to walk upon this guilty sod, and to become the Lamb of God.

When I fall down, you pick me up; when I am dry, you fill my cup; you are my all in all. Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is your name! Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is your name! Informational Notes The expression “all in all,” meaning “everything,” owes much of its endurance in English usage to its appearance in 1 Corinthians 15:28, though many phrases leading up to it here have parallels in Hebrew Scripture. The second section echoes the song to the Lamb in Revelation 5:12.","You are my strength when I am weak; you are the treasure that I seek; you are my all in all. When I fall down, you pick me up; when I am dry, you fill my cup; you are my all in all. Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is your name! Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is your name!"

Taste and see that the Lord is good; in God we need put all our trust. 	(Refrain) Informational Notes Because the first half of verse 8 is the emotional high point of Psalm 34, this paraphrase fittingly uses it as a refrain. In the Christian context of the Lord’s Supper, the invitation to participate (“taste”) is joined with the promise of blessing (“see that the Lord is good”).","Refrain (All): Taste and see, taste and see the goodness of the Lord. O taste and see, taste and see the goodness of the Lord, of the Lord. Leader or All: 1 I will bless the Lord at all times.

In remembrance of me, don’t look above, but in your heart, look for God. Do this in remembrance of me. Informational Notes This text is built on four familiar words of Christ at the Last Supper, as recorded in Luke 22:19 and 1 Corinthians 11:24–25. Radiating from that corporate memory of the church, additional actions are encouraged in Christ’s voice using allusions to other passages of Scripture.","1 In remembrance of me, eat this bread.

(Refrain) Informational Notes As the quotation marks suggest, the first four stanzas and refrain are quoted from Jesus (John 6:35, 44, 51, 53; 11:25), while the fifth stanza draws on the words of Martha (John 11:27), voicing our response also. Being mindful of these differences allows more prayerful singing.","Leader or All: 1 “I am the bread of life. You who come to me shall not hunger, and who believe in me shall not thirst.

(Refrain) Informational Notes Submitted together, this text and tune were chosen from about two hundred entries to be the official hymn for the 41st International Eucharistic Congress held at Philadelphia in 1976. At the center of its many biblical images, the third stanza draws on 1 Corinthians 10:16–17.","Refrain: You satisfy the hungry heart with gift of finest wheat; come give to us, O saving Lord, the bread of life to eat. 1 As when the shepherd calls his sheep, they know and heed his voice, so when you call your family, Lord, we follow and rejoice.

Provide this gift; God’s mercy spread; in weakness God’s compassion show. 3 The rice of God for all is meant; no one who comes is turned away. Believe in Christ whom God has sent; in humble trust God’s will obey. 4 The living rice, for all a sign, came down eternal life to give. Abide in Christ, the living vine; in Christ, with people die and live. Informational Notes For the rice-based peoples of Asia, Jesus’ self-disclosure as the Bread of Life (John 6:35, 51) does not relate to daily experience as it does in Western societies. This hymn seeks to bridge that gap and to alert us to such assumptions. The tune name is Taiwanese for “rice-food.”","1 The rice of life from heaven came to bring true life from God above.

(Refrain) Informational Notes This “communion calypso” (as the author called it) affirms the continuing presence of Christ both in the sacramental meal and in the lives of Christians.

Informational Notes A North American Congregational minister wrote this text as a Christian expansion of the root sense of “good-bye”: God be [with] ye/you. The tune, named for a cousin, was composed by one of the few 20th-century British composers to make a major contribution to hymnody.","God Be with You Till We Meet Again 1 God be with you till we meet again; loving counsels guide, uphold you, with a shepherd's care enfold you: God be with you till we meet again. 2 God be with you till we meet again; unseen wings protecting hide you, daily manna still provide you: God be with you till we meet again. 3 God be with you till we meet again; when life's perils thick confound you, put unfailing arms around you: God be with you till we meet again. 4 God be with you till we meet again; keep love's banner floating o'er you; smite death's threatening wave before you: God be with you till we meet again."

Informational Notes After writing the first stanza of his “Christian Good-bye,” the author sent it to two composers, one celebrated and one unknown, to see how each would set it.

Many such petitions for God’s presence and protection were never written down, but this one is based on an example attributed to St. Patrick.","1 God, be the love to search and keep me; God, be the prayer to move my voice; God, be the strength to now uphold me: O Christ, surround me; O Christ, surround me. 2 Bind to myself the Name of Holy, great cloud of witnesses enfold; prophets, apostles, angels witness: O Christ, surround me; O Christ, surround me. 3 Brightness of sun and glow of moonlight, flashing of lightning, strength of wind, depth of the sea to soil of planet: O Christ, surround me; O Christ, surround me. 4 Walking behind to hem my journey, going ahead to light my way, and from beneath, above, and all ways: O Christ, surround me; O Christ, surround me. 5 Christ in the eyes of all who see me, Christ in the ears that hear my voice, Christ in the hearts of all who know me: O Christ, surround me; O Christ, surround me."

Because this Welsh melody usually sets evening texts, the author was asked to create one for use in daytime. His recasting of the Aaronic blessing in Numbers 6:22–27 imagines that passage as a benediction that might be spoken by God at the conclusion of a worship service.","1 “Go, my children, with my blessing, never alone.

Informational Notes This adaptation of Psalm 149 is organized by themes of praise and service, with a strong implication that they are not really separable but are two aspects of the same God-centered impulse. This text is set to a jubilant tune derived from a late 19th-century English anthem.","1 Give praise to the Lord, and sing a new song; amid all the saints God's praises prolong; a song to your Maker and Ruler now raise, all children of Zion: rejoice and give praise. 2 With timbrel and harp and joyful acclaim, with gladness, O God, we praise your great name; for now in your people good pleasure you seek; with robes of salvation you cover the meek. 3 In glory exult, all saints of the Lord; with song in the night high praises accord; go forth in God's service and strong in God's might to conquer all evil and stand for the right. 4 For this is God's word: the saints shall not fail, but over the earth their power shall prevail; all kingdoms and nations shall yield to their sway. To God give the glory; sing praises for aye."

Hearts unfold like flowers before thee, opening to the sun above. Melt the clouds of sin and sadness; drive the dark of doubt away. Giver of immortal gladness, fill us with the light of day. 2 All thy works with joy surround thee; earth and heaven reflect thy rays; stars and angels sing around thee, center of unbroken praise. Field and forest, vale and mountain, flowery meadow, flashing sea, chanting bird and flowing fountain, call us to rejoice in thee. 3 Mortals, join the happy chorus which the morning stars began. Love divine is reigning o'er us, joining all in heaven's plan. Ever singing, march we onward, victors in the midst of strife. Joyful music leads us sunward in the triumph song of life. Informational Notes This well-known melody was created to provide a choral setting for J. C. F. von Schiller’s poem, “An die Freude” (To Joy), as the final movement of the composer’s Ninth Symphony. The author, a prominent Presbyterian pastor and author, wrote the words with this tune in mind.","1 Joyful, joyful, we adore thee, God of glory, Lord of love! Hearts unfold like flowers before thee, opening to the sun above. Melt the clouds of sin and sadness; drive the dark of doubt away. Giver of immortal gladness, fill us with the light of day. 2 All thy works with joy surround thee; earth and heaven reflect thy rays; stars and angels sing around thee, center of unbroken praise.

We lay it before you; we kneel and adore you; we bless your holy name; glad praises we sing. 2 We worship you, God of our fathers and mothers; through trial and tempest our guide you have been. When perils o’ertake us, you will not forsake us, and with your help, O Lord, our struggles we win. 3 With voices united our praises we offer and gladly our songs of thanksgiving we raise. With you, Lord, beside us, your strong arm will guide us. To you, our great Redeemer, forever be praise! Informational Notes The author wrote this text when only nineteen years old in response to a request from the organist of the Brick Presbyterian Church in New York City, who wanted another Thanksgiving text to sing to this Dutch tune. He regarded the usual text (see no. 336) as too full of conflict.","1 We praise you, O God, our Redeemer, Creator; in grateful devotion our tribute we bring.

O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth. O Lord, we praise your name. O Lord, we magnify your name: Prince of Peace, mighty God; O Lord God Almighty. Informational Notes The repeated opening sentence here quotes Psalm 8:1 (identical with Psalm 8:9), and the Messianic title “Prince of Peace” comes from Isaiah 9:6. The recurring musical patterns make this piece easy to sing, and it appropriately assigns its highest note to the phrase “mighty God.”","O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth. O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth. O Lord, we praise your name. O Lord, we magnify your name: Prince of Peace, mighty God; O Lord God Almighty."

Great are you, Lord: you are faithful and true; by your mercy you prove you are love. Great are you, Lord, and worthy of glory! Great are you, Lord, and worthy of praise. Great are you, Lord. We lift up our voice; we lift up our voice: great are you, Lord! Great are you, Lord! Informational Notes Although it is not a direct paraphrase of any particular psalm, this text echoes “great is the Lord and greatly to be praised,” found in three of them (Psalms 48:1; 96:4; 145:3). Such songs of adoration lift up the heart and mind to God, asking nothing but to enjoy God’s presence.","Great are you, Lord: you are holy and just; by your power we trust in your love. Great are you, Lord: you are faithful and true; by your mercy you prove you are love. Great are you, Lord, and worthy of glory! Great are you, Lord, and worthy of praise. Great are you, Lord.

Informational Notes This is a contemporary worship song that first gained recognition on Christian radio and later became a popular congregational song. “Awesome” here is not a trivial expression but carries the meaning of ""awe-inspiring” and is based on Scripture (e.g. Daniel 9:4).","Our God is an awesome God who reigns from heaven above with wisdom, power, and love; our God is an awesome God!"

Hallelujah! (Refrain) Informational Notes This refrain comes from a longer Punjabi song of praise paraphrasing Psalm 150, which was recorded in Lahore in 1989. As the psalm encourages, singing is customarily accompanied by various small instruments, including the paired (high- and low-toned) hand drums called tabla.","Refrain: Blest be God, praised forever and worshiped; blest be God, praised forever.

618,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create O Love, How Deep, How Broad, How High Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 O love, how deep, how broad, how high, beyond all thought and fantasy, that God, the Son of God, should take our mortal form for mortals' sake. 2 For us baptized, for us he bore his holy fast and hungered sore; for us temptations sharp he knew, for us, the tempter overthrew. 3 For us by wickedness betrayed, for us, in crown of thorns arrayed, he bore the shameful cross and death; for us gave up his dying breath. 4 For us he rose from death again; for us he went on high to reign; for us he sent the Spirit here to guide, to strengthen, and to cheer. 5 All glory to our Lord and God, for love so deep, so high, so broad: the Trinity whom we adore forever and forevermore. Informational Notes Reducing a twenty-three-stanza Latin text to these five English stanzas intensifies this survey of the mystery of the Incarnation and strengthens the repeated reminder that all was done “for us.” A comparable tone of proclamation animates this 15th-century song celebrating a military victory.","1 O love, how deep, how broad, how high, beyond all thought and fantasy, that God, the Son of God, should take our mortal form for mortals' sake. 2 For us baptized, for us he bore his holy fast and hungered sore; for us temptations sharp he knew, for us, the tempter overthrew. 3 For us by wickedness betrayed, for us, in crown of thorns arrayed, he bore the shameful cross and death; for us gave up his dying breath. 4 For us he rose from death again; for us he went on high to reign; for us he sent the Spirit here to guide, to strengthen, and to cheer. 5 All glory to our Lord and God, for love so deep, so high, so broad: the Trinity whom we adore forever and forevermore."

All within me, praise God's name! 4 Angels, teach us adoration; you behold God face to face. Sun and moon and all creation, dwellers all in time and space: Alleluia! Alleluia! Praise with us the God of grace! Informational Notes This adaptation of an older paraphrase of Psalm 103 (see no. 620) is informed by an awareness that much of the received language of religious traditions enshrines social values that obscure the goodness of God, which far transcends all our labels and categories and hierarchies.","1 Praise, my soul, the God of heaven; glad of heart your carols raise; ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, who, like me, should sing God's praise?

Widely yet his mercy flows. 4 Angels, help us to adore him; you behold him face to face. Sun and moon, bow down before him, dwellers all in time and space: Alleluia! Alleluia! Praise with us the God of grace. Informational Notes This free paraphrase of Psalm 103 gains much energy and conviction by including the double “Alleluia!” before the final line of text.  That repeated four-note figure descending from the tune’s highest note gives voice to the praise that the rest of the hymn evokes.","1 Praise, my soul, the King of heaven; to his feet your tribute bring; ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, evermore his praises sing: Alleluia!

Informational Notes This text is based on Psalm 18:3 and 46 in the King James Version and uses musical repetition to give weight to each verse. The earlier verse is treated as a canon with a concluding unison phrase, and the later one is sung through twice in unison to a nearly identical melody.","I will call upon the Lord (I will call upon the Lord) who is worthy to be praised.

(Estribillo) Informational Notes 622	I Will Exalt My God, My King / Te exaltaré, mi Dios, mi Rey (Psalm 145)

Even in translation, this Ecuadoran paraphrase of Psalm 145:1–7 communicates a blend of love and praise that feels more intimate than more formal paraphrases. It may actually be truer to the spirit of the original text, which is an acrostic on the letters of the Hebrew alphabet.","I will exalt my God, my King; I will praise your name forever. I will exalt your name forever. Every day I’ll praise your holy name. Refrain: I will praise your name forever; I will exalt your name forever.

I’ve got love like an ocean; I’ve got love like an ocean; I’ve got love like an ocean, in my soul. Informational Notes In the King James Version, the promise of “peace like a river” is twice mentioned in Isaiah (48:18; 66:12) as a blessing that comes from doing God’s will.  The water imagery of this African American spiritual also provides reminders of Christians’ baptismal identity.","1 I’ve got peace like a river; I’ve got peace like a river; I’ve got peace like a river, in my soul.

O grant to us the grace we find in thee, that we may dwell in perfect unity. 5 Our hope is in no other save in thee; our faith is built upon thy promise free; Lord, give us peace, and make us calm and sure, that in thy strength we evermore endure. Informational Notes The original French text, sometimes attributed to John Calvin, seems to be a Protestant reworking of a Roman Catholic hymn, not a typical practice for him. Yet this text and tune (adapted from GENEVAN 124) clearly date from the early years of the Reformed tradition.","1 I greet thee, who my sure Redeemer art, my only trust and Savior of my heart, who pain didst undergo for my poor sake; I pray thee from our hearts all cares to take. 2 Thou art the King of mercy and of grace, reigning omnipotent in every place: so come, O King, and our whole being sway; shine on us with the light of thy pure day. 3 Thou art the life, by which alone we live, and all our substance and our strength receive; sustain us by thy faith and by thy power, and give us strength in every trying hour. 4 Thou hast the true and perfect gentleness; no harshness hast thou and no bitterness.

Informational Notes This praise chorus begins as a paraphrase of Psalm 42:1 and later incorporates parts of Psalm 28:7. In some early Christian communities, people chanted or sang Psalm 42 on their way to be baptized, and many early Christian baptisteries were decorated with deer drinking water.","As the deer pants for water, so my soul longs after you.

Informational Notes This simple song of adoration provides a significant blend of individual and communal considerations, for although the text is written in the voice of one person, the music involves multiple voices singing in harmony. The resulting experience seems more shared than solitary.","I Love You, Lord I love you, Lord, and I lift my voice to worship you; O my soul, rejoice.

Informational Notes This simple song based on Psalm 9:1–2 was created in the mid-1970s for a morning devotional of a group touring in the picturesque high Alps. Later it was incorporated into their programs and soon spread throughout Europe and the world, being translated into many languages.","1 Praise, I will praise you, Lord, with all my heart.

The love of Jesus, what it is none but his loved ones know. 5 Jesus, our only joy be thou, as thou our prize wilt be. Jesus, be thou our glory now, and through eternity. Informational Notes The sweetness celebrated in this anonymous 12th-century Latin poem is not cloying or sentimental; it is more like an antidote to bitterness and a source of hope and healing. The best-known 19th-century translation is set here to a tune composed especially for these words.","1 Jesus, the very thought of thee with sweetness fills my breast. But sweeter far thy face to see, and in thy presence rest. 2 Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame, nor can the mind recall a sweeter sound than thy blest name, O Savior of us all. 3 O hope of every contrite heart, O joy of all the meek, to those who fall, how kind thou art!

Jesus is fairer; Jesus is purer, who makes the woeful heart to sing. 3 Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight, and all the twinkling, starry host. Jesus shines brighter; Jesus shines purer, than all the angels heaven can boast. 4 Beautiful Savior, Ruler of the nations, Son of God and Son of Man! Glory and honor, praise, adoration, now and forevermore be thine! Informational Notes Franz Liszt used this melody for a “Crusaders’ March” in an oratorio, but this hymn had nothing to do with the Crusades. No record of the German text exists before the middle of the 17th century or of the Silesian folk melody before the first half of the 19th century.","1 Fairest Lord Jesus, Ruler of all nature, O thou of God to earth come down, thee will I cherish, thee will I honor, thou, my soul's glory, joy, and crown. 2 Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands, robed in the blooming garb of spring.

All the peoples of the nations will bow down to you; may your name be exalted here on earth and in heaven above. Informational Notes This text based on the affirmative later parts of Psalm 22 (especially verses 3, 22–28) has an unusual structure, with alternating lines of stanza and refrain. It also has an uncommon history, as the first stanza was written in New Zealand and the remaining stanzas in Canada.","1 In the presence of your people I will praise your name, for alone you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel.

(Refrain) May we trust in God, rest in God’s strong hand, live in God’s strong love, follow God’s commands.

This retelling is also intended to prevent the hearers from repeating their ancestors’ mistakes.","People of the Lord, listen to my voice. Hear the ancient words. Once again rejoice!

Couched in a syncopated African American gospel style, the setting invites the addition of instruments, though the voices of singers remain most important.","Refrain: Praise ye the Lord, Hallelujah!

(Refrain) Informational Notes This American gospel song became popular in England in the late 19th century, then returned to this country in the mid-20th century with the Billy Graham crusades. Its continuing popularity may well be due to the freedom from subjective considerations in its praise of God.","1 To God be the glory; great things he has done!

Informational Notes By the way the notes fall on the syllables, repeated singing reveals that this refrain based on Psalm 117:1 originally set the Latin text. The refrains of the ecumenical community at Taizé, France, often use Latin because it is not the language of any current political power.","Sing, praise, and bless the Lord.

Let all the world in every corner sing, my God and King! Informational Notes The 20th-century tune used here is among the few to honor the intention of the author, a 17th-century Anglican pastor and poet, to sing the refrain before, between, and after the two stanzas. The mention of “psalms” in the second stanza is a clue that hymns were not yet common.","Let all the world in every corner sing, my God and King! 1 The heavens are not too high, God's praise may thither fly; the earth is not too low, God's praises there may grow.

Informational Notes This selection of paraphrased verses from Psalm 95 was prepared by a joint committee of nine North American churches in the Reformed tradition.  It is set here to an anonymous and originally nameless tune, eventually named to reflect that its first publication was in Dublin.","1 O come and sing unto the Lord; to God our voices raise; let us in our most joyful songs the Lord, our Savior, praise. 2 Before God's presence let us come with praise and thankful voice; let us sing psalms to God with grace; with grateful hearts, rejoice. 3 The Lord our God is King of kings, above all gods enthroned; the depths of earth and mountains high by God alone are owned. 4 To God the spacious sea belongs; God made its waves and tides, and by God's hand the rising land was formed, and still abides. 5 O come, and bowing down to God our worship let us bring; yea, let us kneel before the Lord, our Maker and our King."

Informational Notes Although this hymn is often used on large and festive occasions, its first two stanzas had much humbler beginnings:  they originated as a family table prayer during the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648). These words have been associated with this tune since the mid-17th century.","1 Now thank we all our God with heart and hands and voices, who wondrous things hath done, in whom this world rejoices; who, from our mothers' arms, hath blessed us on our way with countless gifts of love, and still is ours today. 2 O may this bounteous God through all our life be near us, with ever joyful hearts and blessed peace to cheer us; and keep us in God's grace, and guide us when perplexed, and free us from all ills in this world and the next. 3 All praise and thanks to God, who reigns in highest heaven, to Father and to Son and Spirit now be given: the one eternal God, whom heaven and earth adore, the God who was, and is, and shall be evermore."

The beauty that draws us to God also urges us to work for mercy and justice.","1 O beauty ever ancient, O beauty ever new, divine and Holy Presence, my being sings to you, in gratitude, in worship my being sings to you! 2 O beauty in creation, in world of sound and sight, O beauty in the silence, in darkness as in light, in gratitude, in worship my being sings to you! 3 O beauty that is movement in liquid line of grace, O beauty that is stillness in lovely form or face, in gratitude, in worship my being sings to you! 4 O beauty of the Spirit where love is shining through, O beauty ever ancient, O beauty ever new, in gratitude, in worship my being sings to you!"

Many will marvel open-eyed and put their trust in God. 4 Great wonders you have done, O Lord, all purposed for our good. Unable every one to name, I bow in gratitude. Informational Notes Psalm 40 is generally understood to be in two parts, an opening section of thanksgiving and a concluding section of lament. This 20th-century paraphrase is based on the earlier portion, and the third stanza is a significant testimony to the importance of singing God’s praise.","1 I waited patiently for God, for God to hear my prayer; and God bent down to where I sank and listened to me there. 2 God raised me from a miry pit, from mud and sinking sand, and set my feet upon a rock where I can firmly stand. 3 And on my lips a song was put, a new song to the Lord.

Among the saints I lift my voice: in you, O God, I will rejoice. 2 Your name is known in all the lands. You feed the poor with gentle hands. Your word is true, your works are just; in you, O God, the faithful trust. 3 With saving love you set us free, and still you dwell in mystery with wisdom none can comprehend. Your praise, O God, will never end. Informational Notes This paraphrase of Psalm 111 preserves the psalm’s quality of providing a general list of God’s praiseworthy characteristics rather than giving thanks for a particular act of deliverance. In the original text these attributes are organized as an acrostic on the Hebrew alphabet.","1 A grateful heart is what I bring, a song of praise, my offering. Among the saints I lift my voice: in you, O God, I will rejoice. 2 Your name is known in all the lands. You feed the poor with gentle hands.

Let all who know God's saving love sing grateful songs always. 2 If you have ever wandered where no human help was near, and in your trouble cried to God, who rescued you from fear, then thank the God of steadfast love who dries your every tear. 3 If you have ever lived inside the prison of your gloom and cried to God, who broke your bonds and raised you from your tomb, then praise the One who sets you free, who makes dry places bloom. 4 If you drew near the gates of death, too sick to eat or dress, and cried to God, who heard your voice and healed all your distress, then sing with sounds of holy joy; God's wondrous works profess. 5 If you have felt your courage fail before a violent sea and cried to God, who stilled the storm, and made the wild wind flee, then in the congregation praise the One who heard your plea. 6 So praise the One whose love is great, whose kindness is well-known. Consider well the healing hand and help you have been shown, and tell the world what God has done. Praise God and God alone! Informational Notes The singing of psalm paraphrases is the most longstanding musical practice in Reformed tradition, dating from John Calvin’s own congregation in Geneva in the 16th century. This recent paraphrase of Psalm 107 illustrates the interpretive flexibility that is a hallmark of the form.","1 Give thanks to God who hears our cries and saves in troubled days with wondrous works to humankind that call for highest praise.

Lift up your voices, the Lord is near. Lift up your voices; the Lord is near. Informational Notes This refrain from the ecumenical monastic community at Taizé, France, is meant for repeated singing. A wonderful quilt of psalm-like phrases, it would be appropriate at any time but the concluding emphasis on the nearness of the Lord makes it especially fitting for use in Advent.","In the Lord I’ll be ever thankful; in the Lord I will rejoice! Look to God; do not be afraid. Lift up your voices, the Lord is near. Lift up your voices; the Lord is near."

Informational Notes Selecting these four stanzas from eleven that formed a second paraphrase of Psalm 116 in their original volume has made the theme of gratitude for God’s protection and bounty more apparent. The tune that sets them may have its origins in an 18th-century Scottish folksong.","1 What shall I render to the Lord; what shall my offering be, for all the gracious benefits God hath bestowed on me? 2 Salvation's cup my soul shall take while to the Lord I pray, and with God's people I will meet, my thankful vows to pay. 3 Not lightly dost thou, Lord, permit thy chosen saints to die; from death thou hast delivered me; thy servant, Lord, am I. 4 Within God's house, the house of prayer, my soul shall bless the Lord, and praises to God's holy name let all the saints accord."

O, can’t turn around, we’ve come this far by faith. We’ve come this far by faith. Informational Notes This refrain from a longer hymn could well be understood as a black gospel reflection on several biblical passages: 2 Corinthians 5:7, 1 Samuel 7:12, and 1 Chronicles 17:16. All these texts bear witness to God’s faithfulness towards all who are engaged in the pilgrimage of faith.","We’ve come this far by faith, leaning on the Lord, trusting in the holy Word; God’s never failed us yet.

(Refrain) 4 God’s discernment never favors strength or speed to lift or move; God delights in those who worship, trusting in God’s steadfast love. 	(Refrain) Informational Notes The five songs of praise that conclude the biblical psalter (Psalms 146–150) all begin and end with “Hallelujah!” That ecstatic Hebrew word is expanded here into the refrain that opens and closes this paraphrase of Psalm 147, an appropriate frame for its theme of thanksgiving.","Refrain: Sing to God, with joy and gladness, hymns and psalms of gratitude; with the voice of praise discover that to worship God is good. 1 God unites the scattered people, gathers those who wandered far, heals the hurt and broken spirits, tending every wound and scar.

Informational Notes The exact origins of this chorus celebrating God’s providential care are not clear, but it seems to have arisen during the 1970s. Because the text changes so little, the slowly rising four-note pattern of the tune provides the primary source of energy within its five-note range.",3 God loves me so; God loves me so; God loves me so; God’s so good to me. 4 God is so good; God is so good; God is so good; God’s so good to me.

Informational Notes This sung table grace provides words for a melody from the Bunun people of Taiwan. Because the “tom tom” lines in the lower voices of this setting are intended to imitate the sounds made when pounding rice, this sung prayer is also a way of remembering all whose labors feed us.","1 Lord, we thank you for this food; help us share with all in need; body, soul refresh anew to live the Gospel, serve your people, 2 Lord, we thank you for this food; help us share with all in need; body, soul refresh anew to live the Gospel, give your people love."

Refrain: I sing because I’m happy, (I’m happy) I sing because I’m free, (I’m free) for his eye is on the sparrow, and I know he watches me. 2 “Let not your heart be troubled,” his tender word I hear, and resting on his goodness, I lose my doubts and fears; though by the path he leadeth but one step I may see: his eye is on the sparrow, and I know he watches me; his eye is on the sparrow, and I know he watches me.

(Refrain) Informational Notes This hymn based on Jesus’ saying about God’s care for all creatures (Matthew 10:29–30/Luke12:6–7) began with the refrain’s last line, inspired by a woman who had endured much illness. It was first sung in public at the Royal Albert Hall, London, during evangelistic services in 1905.","1 Why should I feel discouraged? Why should the shadows come?

Informational Notes This well-crafted morning hymn opens by celebrating daylight as an image of Christ, the true Light, then ponders life without light, and culminates in a prayer for inward light. The tune’s name honors its German roots: Ratisbon is the former English name for Regensburg.","1 Christ, whose glory fills the skies; Christ, the true, the only light; Sun of Righteousness, arise; triumph o'er the shades of night; Dayspring from on high, be near; Daystar, in my heart appear. 2 Dark and cheerless is the morn unaccompanied by thee; joyless is the day's return till thy mercy's beams I see; till they inward light impart, cheer my eyes and warm my heart. 3 Visit then this soul of mine; pierce the gloom of sin and grief; fill me, radiancy divine; scatter all my unbelief; more and more thyself display, shining to the perfect day."

Informational Notes These three stanzas (of the original fifteen) convey the essence of the morning hymn that was paired with “All Praise to Thee, My God, This Night” (no. 675) in the daily devotions of the boys at Winchester College. This tune was later composed especially for these words.","1 Awake, my soul, and with the sun your daily stage of duty run; shake off dull sloth, and joyful rise to pay your morning sacrifice. 2 Lord, I my vows to you renew.

Praise with elation; praise every morning, God's re-creation of the new day! Informational Notes This 20th-century text was created to provide words for this traditional tune named for a small village on the Isle of Mull, off the west coast of Scotland.  Through repeated use of “new” and “first,” each morning is treated as a re-creation of the promise of the original day.","1 Morning has broken like the first morning; blackbird has spoken like the first bird.

He wrote with this Genevan tune in mind, which initiated this continuing pairing of words and music.","1 O gladsome light, O grace of our Creator's face, the eternal splendor wearing: celestial, holy, blest, our Savior Jesus Christ, joyful in your appearing. 2 As fades the day's last light, we see the lamps of night our common hymn outpouring, O God of might unknown, you, the incarnate Son, and Spirit blest adoring. 3 To you of right belongs all praise of holy songs, O Son of God, Life-giver; you, therefore, O Most High, the world does glorify and shall exalt forever."
673,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create Jesus, Light of Joy Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 Jesus, light of joy, surround us; let your splendid glory shine: source of every earthly blessing, heaven’s everlasting sign. Alleluia, alleluia, we adore you, light divine. 2 Now the shadows fall around us; now the evening has begun: still your gracious light is with us, brighter than the morning sun. Alleluia, alleluia, God of glory, Three-in-One. 3 With the saints we lift our voices, God of power, God of might. All creation shines with glory, singing praises day and night: alleluia, alleluia, holy, holy, holy light. Informational Notes The images of light in this text are drawn from the ancient Christian vesper hymn Phos hilaron, which dates from at least the 3rd century. (For other versions, see nos. 671 and 672.) That rather brief original hymn is augmented here in the third stanza by language based on the Sanctus.","1 Jesus, light of joy, surround us; let your splendid glory shine: source of every earthly blessing, heaven’s everlasting sign. Alleluia, alleluia, we adore you, light divine. 2 Now the shadows fall around us; now the evening has begun: still your gracious light is with us, brighter than the morning sun.

Informational Notes This paraphrase of Psalm 141 is held together by the simple dignity of its language rather than by rhyme. There is a surprising immediacy in this private prayer, offered at the end of a tiring and trying day and seeking strength to avoid saying things that are untrue or hurtful.","1 I call, O Lord, on you: come quickly to my aid; hear from your throne in heaven above my cry of deep distress. 2 Lord, let my prayer ascend like incense in your sight; see in my hands to heaven above my evening sacrifice. 3 Set, Lord, a guard to keep close watch upon my mouth; let no rebellious word escape your seal upon my lips. 4 Have pity, Lord, on me; you are my strength, my shield: you are my refuge in all ills; I turn in trust to you."

Keep me, O keep me safe from harm within the shelter of thine arm! 2 Forgive me, Lord, through Christ, I pray, the wrong that I have done this day, that I, before I sleep, may be at peace with neighbor, self, and thee. 3 O may my soul on thee repose, and with sweet sleep mine eyelids close. Refresh my strength, for thine own sake, to serve thee well when I awake. 4 Praise God, from whom all blessings flow; praise God, all creatures here below; praise God above, ye heavenly host; praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Informational Notes 675	All Praise to Thee, My God, This Night

Originally consisting of twelve stanzas, this was the bedtime hymn of the boys at Winchester School in England. Now it is one of the best-known evening hymns in English (usually matched with this tune and sung in canon), and its final stanza has taken on a life of its own.","1 All praise to thee, my God, this night, for all the blessings of the light! Keep me, O keep me safe from harm within the shelter of thine arm! 2 Forgive me, Lord, through Christ, I pray, the wrong that I have done this day, that I, before I sleep, may be at peace with neighbor, self, and thee. 3 O may my soul on thee repose, and with sweet sleep mine eyelids close.

God, our Maker, none forsaking, take our hearts, of love's own making; watch our sleeping; guard our waking; be always near. 2 Dark descends, but light unending shines through our night; you are with us, ever lending new strength to sight: one in love, your truth confessing, one in hope of heaven's blessing, may we see, in love's possessing, love's endless light! 3 Eyes will close, but you unsleeping watch by our side. Death may come; in love's safekeeping still we abide. God of love, all evil quelling, sin forgiving, fear dispelling, stay with us, our hearts indwelling, this eventide. Informational Notes This 20th-century hymn by a Scottish Jesuit paraphrases several traditional evening prayers and takes its shape from the familiar Welsh tune to which it is set. Its rhyme pattern requires considerable poetic skill, as only three rhymes serve for the eight lines of text.","1 Day is done, but love unfailing dwells ever here; shadows fall, but hope, prevailing, calms every fear. God, our Maker, none forsaking, take our hearts, of love's own making; watch our sleeping; guard our waking; be always near. 2 Dark descends, but light unending shines through our night; you are with us, ever lending new strength to sight: one in love, your truth confessing, one in hope of heaven's blessing, may we see, in love's possessing, love's endless light! 3 Eyes will close, but you unsleeping watch by our side.

To thee our morning hymns ascended; thy praise shall hallow now our rest. 2 We thank thee that thy church unsleeping, while earth rolls onward into light, through all the world a watch is keeping and rests not now by day or night. 3 As o’er each continent and island the dawn leads on another day, the voice of prayer is never silent, nor dies the song of praise away. 4 The sun that bids us rest is waking thy children ‘neath the western sky, and hour by hour fresh lips are making thy wondrous doings heard on high. 5 So be it, Lord; thy throne shall never, like earth's proud empires, pass away; thy kingdom stands, and grows forever until there dawns thy glorious day. Informational Notes Written as a confident expression of missionary expansion, this text has become a humbler evening reflection concerning the rest of the world and humanity’s place in God’s universe. The tune name honors both the composer’s given name and the church where he was baptized.","1 The day thou gavest, Lord, is ended; the darkness falls at thy behest.

Like other chants from the Taizé Community in France, this paraphrase of Psalm 139:12 is meant for repeated singing. It is most effective at evening services and works well with other Taizé chants such as “Within Our Darkest Night” (no. 294) and “The Lord Is My Light” (no. 842).",Our darkness is never darkness in your sight: the deepest night is clear as the daylight.

From the north to southern pole let the mighty chorus roll: ""Holy, holy, holy One, glory be to God alone!"" Informational Notes Originally this text was more than twice as long as the present version because it followed Psalm 148 in directing additional parts of the created order to praise God. This wide-ranging text is set here to a suitably expansive and well-crafted 17th-century chorale melody.","1 Let the whole creation cry, ""Glory to the Lord on high.""

Deep within the soil of our hearts seeds of love begin to take root. Summer brings floods, tempest and storm; sun breaks forth; birds tend their young. Then the day of harvest will come, when we gather all that God gives. 2 Tender young shoots, green in the sun, glisten with the beauty of spring. God will watch and care for each one, bring the growth and strength to bear fruit, speaking the word, quenching their thirst, hearing their prayer, feeding their souls. God will love and care for each one, till the bright day harvest will come. 3 Our hearts are filled: God gives us grace; overflowing we give our praise. We come humbly bringing our thanks, bring our hearts and offer them back. Our harvest here on God’s rich earth, all is a gift God freely makes. Lord and Savior, we sing your praise, thank and bless you all of our days. Informational Notes This gentle text celebrates the changing seasons as testimony to God’s care for all creation, and meditating on that theme inspires thanks. The tune name is pronounced “peacocks,” and commemorates the Presbyterian Committee on Congregational Song, who compiled this hymnal.","1 Soft rains of spring flow through the fields; earth awakes and greets a new year.

The highest heavens in which God reigns shall now resound with praise. Informational Notes These stanzas provide Watts’s paraphrase of Psalm 118:24–29 (minus a stanza he inserted about Easter and Pentecost as part of his effort to Christianize the Psalms). They are set to a tune composed for and named by a Paul Gerhardt text, “Now Let All Thank and Bring Honor.”","1 This is the day the Lord hath made; the hours are all God's own.

It is good when night is falling of your faithfulness to tell, while with sweet, melodious praises songs of adoration swell. 2 You have filled my heart with gladness through the works your hands have wrought; you have made my life victorious; great your works and deep your thought. You, O Lord, on high exalted, reign forevermore in might; all your enemies shall perish, sin be banished from your sight. 3 But the good shall live before you, planted in your dwelling place, fruited trees and ever verdant, nourished by your boundless grace. In his goodness to the righteous God his righteousness displays; God, my rock, my strength and refuge, just and true are all your ways. Informational Notes Psalm 92, paraphrased here, is the only psalm that the Bible assigns to a specific day: the Sabbath. This may be because of the mention of “works” in stanza two, recalling that, after six days of creation, God rested on the Sabbath (Genesis 2:2–3), when the faithful do the same.","1 It is good to sing your praises and to thank you, O Most High, showing forth your loving kindness when the morning lights the sky.

Informational Notes When first published in 1931, this “All-Day Hymn” (as it was titled) seemed very daring for not using traditional archaic pronouns to address Christ. Current pronouns no longer disturb, but the comforting Jesus portrayed here needs to be balanced by his call to discipleship.","1 Lord of all hopefulness, Lord of all joy, whose trust, ever childlike, no cares could destroy: be there at our waking and give us, we pray, your bliss in our hearts, Lord, at the break of the day. 2 Lord of all eagerness, Lord of all faith, whose strong hands were skilled at the plane and the lathe: be there at our labors and give us, we pray, your strength in our hearts, Lord, at the noon of the day. 3 Lord of all kindliness, Lord of all grace, your hands swift to welcome, your arms to embrace: be there at our homing and give us, we pray, your love in our hearts, Lord, at the eve of the day. 4 Lord of all gentleness, Lord of all calm, whose voice is contentment, whose presence is balm: be there at our sleeping and give us, we pray, your peace in our hearts, Lord, at the end of the day."

Informational Notes This text affirms that faith is not a state of being but a process of becoming what we are called to be in relationship to God, other people, and the world. The movement from one stage of faith to another is suggested by gestures of the hand: letting go, holding on, reaching out.","1 Faith begins by letting go, giving up what had seemed sure, taking risks and pressing on, though the way feels less secure: pilgrimage both right and odd, trusting all our life to God. 2 Faith endures by holding on, keeping memory’s roots alive so that hope may bear its fruit; promise-fed, our souls will thrive, not through merit we possess but by God’s great faithfulness. 3 Faith matures by reaching out, stretching minds, enlarging hearts, sharing struggles, living prayer, binding up the broken parts; till we find the commonplace ripe with witness to God’s grace."

Make their hearts, as you have shown us, quick, when wounded, to forgive. 5 God, through all the years before them, let your hand their hands uphold. On their unseen way befriend them; with your love their love enfold. Informational Notes This wedding or anniversary text effectively weaves together metaphorical and literal references to hands. The metaphors, referring to God’s providential care, are always singular, while the human references all involve more than one hand and evoke visual and tactile images.","1 Unseen God, your hand has guided these two lives on separate ways till they heard your call to travel hand in hand through all their days. 2 You have made them in your image, formed them for community.

He wrote these words especially for this tune, originally composed for John Henry Newman’s text “Lead, Kindly Light.”","1 God of our life, through all the circling years, we trust in thee.

Informational Notes Many people sing this hymn unaware that it paraphrases Psalm 90, partly because this text speaks so immediately to the human condition. Since the middle of the 19th century, it has usually been joined to this tune named for the London parish where the composer was organist.","1 Our God, our help in ages past, our hope for years to come, our shelter from the stormy blast, and our eternal home: 2 Beneath the shadow of thy throne thy saints have dwelt secure; sufficient is thine arm alone, and our defense is sure. 3 Before the hills in order stood, or earth received its frame, from everlasting thou art God, to endless years the same. 4 A thousand ages in thy sight are like an evening gone, short as the watch that ends the night before the rising sun. 5 Time, like an ever rolling stream, bears all our years away; they fly forgotten, as a dream dies at the opening day. 6 Our God, our help in ages past, our hope for years to come, be thou our guard while life shall last, and our eternal home."

I see thy cross; there teach my heart to cling. O let me seek thee, and O let me find! 4 Teach me to feel that thou art always nigh. Teach me the struggles of the soul to bear, to check the rising doubt, the rebel sigh. Teach me the patience of unanswered prayer. 5 Teach me to love thee as thine angels love, one holy passion filling all my frame; the baptism of the heaven-descended Dove, my heart an altar, and thy love the flame. Informational Notes This reflection on Galatians 5:25 was written by a literary Anglican clergyman whose preaching drew people of many social classes to one of the formerly poorer London churches. The tune was created for “Abide with Me” (no. 836) but more often appears with the present text.","1 Spirit of God, descend upon my heart; wean it from earth, through all its pulses move; stoop to my weakness, mighty as thou art, and make me love thee as I ought to love. 2 I ask no dream, no prophet ecstasies, no sudden rending of the veil of clay, no angel visitant, no opening skies; but take the dimness of my soul away. 3 Hast thou not bid us love thee, God and King; all, all thine own, soul, heart, and strength, and mind?

Informational Notes Opening with imagery from Job 38:7, this text celebrates the role of music in worship from earliest times to the present. It is set to a German tune that may have originated as a folk melody. The tune name, German for “white flags,” comes from one of the early texts set to it.","1 When the morning stars together their Creator's glory sang, and the angel host all shouted till with joy the heavens rang, then your wisdom and your greatness their exultant music told, all the beauty and the splendor which your mighty works unfold. 2 When in synagogue and temple voices raised the psalmists' songs, offering up the adoration which alone to you belongs; when the singers, trumpets, cymbals all combined, your praise to share, awestruck people saw your glory fill the sacred house of prayer. 3 Voice and instrument in union through the ages spoke your praise.

For you alone can make me whole, O Lord, my refuge and my might. Informational Notes This paraphrase of Psalm 19 was part of a longer work commissioned by the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church for its Bicentennial Anniversary in 1982. The three stanzas reflect the psalm’s three themes: creation, the giving of the Law, and the human response to these gifts.","1 God’s glory fills the heavens with hymns; the domed sky bears the Maker’s mark; new praises sound from day to day and echo through the knowing dark.

Informational Notes Written for the confirmation of the author’s son, this text of self-dedication also voices our recurring individual need to recommit ourselves in less formal ways. The familiar shape note tune enhances a sense of finding our place among God’s people from all times and places.","1 Lord, when I came into this life you called me by my name; today I come, commit myself, responding to your claim. 2 Within the circle of the faith, as member of your cast, I take my place with all the saints of future, present, past. 3 In all the tensions of my life, between my faith and doubt, let your great Spirit give me hope, sustain me, lead me out. 4 So help me in my unbelief and let my life be true: feet firmly planted on the earth, my sights set high on you."

As you love may I love, in receiving and in giving. Spirit, open my heart. 1 God, replace my stony heart with a heart that's kind and tender. All my coldness and fear to your grace I now surrender.	(Refrain) 2 Write your love upon my heart as my law, my goal, my story. In each thought, word, and deed, may my living bring you glory. 	(Refrain) 3 May I weep with those who weep; share the joy of sister, brother. In the welcome of Christ, may we welcome one another. 	(Refrain) Informational Notes The pace and diversity of modern life often hinder us from remaining vulnerable to our emotions and to the humanness of other people. This prayerful text to be open to such joys and pains draws on Ezekiel 11:19 and 36:26 in stanza one and echoes Jeremiah 31:33 in stanza two.","Refrain: Spirit, open my heart to the joy and pain of living. As you love may I love, in receiving and in giving. Spirit, open my heart. 1 God, replace my stony heart with a heart that's kind and tender. All my coldness and fear to your grace I now surrender.

693,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create Though I May Speak Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 Though I may speak with bravest fire, and have the gift to all inspire, and have not love, my words are vain, as sounding brass, and hopeless gain. 2 Though I may give all I possess, and striving so my love profess, but not be given by love within, the profit soon turns strangely thin. 3 Come, Spirit, come, our hearts control; our spirits long to be made whole. Let inward love guide every deed; by this we worship, and are freed. Informational Notes As paraphrases of 1 Corinthians 13:1, 3 the first two stanzas here are in the first person singular, yet they lead into a plural prayer for the gift of such love, for it thrives in community. These words are especially poignant with this adaptation of an English folk melody.","1 Though I may speak with bravest fire, and have the gift to all inspire, and have not love, my words are vain, as sounding brass, and hopeless gain. 2 Though I may give all I possess, and striving so my love profess, but not be given by love within, the profit soon turns strangely thin. 3 Come, Spirit, come, our hearts control; our spirits long to be made whole.

How can we hope to thank you? Our praise is but a start: sincerely and completely I offer you my heart. 2 Your Word is our salvation, the source of endless grace, in death and life extending your covenant embrace. In Christ we are one body; each member has a part: sincerely and completely I offer you my heart. 3 Your Spirit is our teacher, the light that guides our search, transforming broken people into the holy church. For feeding us with mercy, for wisdom you impart: sincerely and completely I offer you my heart. Informational Notes Written for the 500th anniversary of John Calvin’s birth, this text sums up his liturgical theology, ending each stanza with his motto: Cor meum tibi offero, Domine, prompte et sincere. By moving from plural to singular the stanzas show how corporate faith becomes personal piety.","1 Great God of every blessing, of faithful, loving care, you are the fount of goodness, the daily bread we share.

695,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create Change My Heart, O God Added to Favorites Lyrics Informational Notes The central image of the potter and the clay in this text comes from Isaiah 64:8 (and there is a similar reference in Jeremiah 18:1–6), while the petition for a changed heart is similar to Psalm 51:10. Such readiness to do God’s will is a significant feature of the spiritual life.",
696,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create O God, You Are My God Alone Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 O God, you are my God alone, whom eagerly I seek, though longing fills my soul with thirst and leaves my body weak. Just as a dry and barren land awaits a freshening shower, I long within your house to see your glory and your power. 2 Your faithful love surpasses life, evoking all my praise. Through every day, to bless your name, my hands in joy I’ll raise. My deepest needs you satisfy as with a sumptuous feast. So, on my lips and in my heart, your praise has never ceased. 3 Throughout the night I lie in bed and call you, Lord, to mind; in darkest hours I meditate how God, my strength, is kind. Beneath the shadow of your wing, I live and feel secure; and daily as I follow close, your right hand keeps me sure. Informational Notes Given its wide range of references, scholars have proposed many occasions and uses for Psalm 63. Because of the imagery that opens stanza three in this paraphrase, for example, the great Reformed theologian and scholar Theodore Beza regularly recited this psalm at night.","1 O God, you are my God alone, whom eagerly I seek, though longing fills my soul with thirst and leaves my body weak. Just as a dry and barren land awaits a freshening shower, I long within your house to see your glory and your power. 2 Your faithful love surpasses life, evoking all my praise.

697,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create Take My Life Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 Take my life and let it be consecrated, Lord, to thee; take my moments and my days; let them flow in ceaseless praise; let them flow in ceaseless praise. 2 Take my hands and let them move at the impulse of thy love; take my feet and let them be swift and beautiful for thee, swift and beautiful for thee. 3 Take my voice and let me sing always, only, for my King; take my lips and let them be filled with messages from thee, filled with messages from thee. 4 Take my sliver and my gold; not a mite would I withhold; take my intellect and use every power as thou shalt choose, every power as thou shalt choose. 5 Take my will and make it thine; it shall be no longer mine. Take my heart, it is thine own; it shall be thy royal throne, it shall be thy royal throne. 6 Take my love; my Lord, I pour at thy feet its treasure store; take myself and I will be ever, only, all for thee, ever, only, all for thee. Informational Notes This hymn of consecration radiates from the repeated word “take,” resulting in a remarkably full survey of a person’s attributes and possessions and giving weight to the “all” at the end. The composer of the tune was influential in the renewal of Reformed hymnody in French.","1 Take my life and let it be consecrated, Lord, to thee; take my moments and my days; let them flow in ceaseless praise; let them flow in ceaseless praise. 2 Take my hands and let them move at the impulse of thy love; take my feet and let them be swift and beautiful for thee, swift and beautiful for thee. 3 Take my voice and let me sing always, only, for my King; take my lips and let them be filled with messages from thee, filled with messages from thee. 4 Take my sliver and my gold; not a mite would I withhold; take my intellect and use every power as thou shalt choose, every power as thou shalt choose. 5 Take my will and make it thine; it shall be no longer mine.

Informational Notes The brevity of this text and tune invite repeated singing, either as a sustained chain of sound or as a sung response in a series of prayers. It offers a more reflective approach to the same theme of self-dedication evident in older hymns such as “Just as I Am” (see no. 442).","Take, O take me as I am; summon out what I shall be; set your seal upon my heart and live in me."

(Refrain) 2 It’s my desire to live for you and to always walk upright; give me the strength to face each day; stay with me through each dark night. 	(Refrain) Informational Notes The refrain of this gospel song by a well-known Presbyterian pastor and musician can be understood as a meditation on Psalm 23:5, while the stanzas reflect an updated and easily accessible interpretation of the prayer often attributed to St. Francis of Assisi (see no. 753).","Refrain: Fill my cup; let it overflow; fill my cup; let it overflow; fill my cup; let it overflow; let it overflow with love. 1 Lord, let me be your instrument, spreading sunshine in the land; let people see your works in me; help me live the best I can.

Informational Notes This African American spiritual has more depth than may at first appear: for people who are bound in slavery to sing about dedicating themselves to God’s use shows a profound awareness of God-given self-worth despite circumstances that would deny their human or spiritual value.","1 I’m gonna live so God can use me anywhere, Lord, anytime!

With thanksgiving, I’ll be a living sanctuary for you. Informational Notes The lines given here convey the central message of the longer song for which they form the refrain. The principal Scripture reference is 1 Corinthians 3:16–17, Paul’s reminder to the Christians at Corinth that “[they] are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in [them].”","Lord, prepare me to be a sanctuary, pure and holy, tried and true. With thanksgiving, I’ll be a living sanctuary for you."

Christ in my sleeping, Christ in my sitting, Christ in my rising, Light of my life. 3 Christ be in all hearts thinking about me; Christ be on all tongues telling of me. Christ be the vision in eyes that see me; in ears that hear me Christ ever be. Informational Notes This text adapts part of a traditional Irish prayer associated with St. Patrick (see also no. 6).  Such a prayer for protection is known as a lorica, from a Latin word for “breastplate” or “armor.” It is set to a Gaelic melody that gained wide popularity in the 1970s.","1 Christ be beside me; Christ be before me; Christ be behind me, King of my heart.

Thine wholly, thine alone, I’d live; myself to thee entirely give. 2 O grant that nothing in my soul may dwell, but thy pure love alone; O may thy love possess me whole, my joy, my treasure, and my crown! All coldness from my heart remove; may every act, word, thought be love. 3 O Love, how gracious is thy way! All fear before thy presence flies; care, anguish, sorrow melt away where’er thy healing beams arise. O Jesus, nothing may I see, nothing desire, or seek, but thee. Informational Notes John Wesley learned the original German hymn from the Moravians during his time in Savannah, Georgia, and translated all sixteen stanzas. The tune, named for a 4th-century martyr, comes out of the Roman Catholic revival movement of the mid-19th century.","1 Jesus, thy boundless love to me no thought can reach, no tongue declare; O knit my thankful heart to thee, and reign without a rival there!

You’re my Prince of Peace, and I will live my life for you. Informational Notes Songs of personal devotion to Christ have long formed part of congregational song, a tradition continued in this contemporary praise and worship song. The two parts suggest the voices of heart and mind, the latter being distinguished by familiarity with many scriptural images.","Part 1 You are holy; you are mighty; you are worthy, worthy of praise.

Informational Notes John Calvin summarized Psalm 37 by saying, “It enjoins us to confide in the providence of God.” This compact paraphrase maintains that perspective by drawing mainly on the psalm’s promises and assurances rather than on its descriptions of the activities of the wicked.","1 Commit your way to God the Lord: your cause will shine as bright as fire; delight to do God’s holy word and you shall find what you desire. 2 Be still before the Lord and wait, and do not fret when wrong succeeds; refrain from anger, turn from hate, for God will punish evil deeds. 3 Salvation comes from God alone: the faithful know their help is sure; to heaven, all our needs are known, and in God’s strength we are secure. 4 Commit your way to God the Lord; to peace and truth and grace aspire; then mercy shall be your reward; God's promises, your heart's desire."

Hold thou full sway; have in our inmost souls thy perfect way; guard thou each sacred hour from selfish ease; guide thou our ordered lives as thou dost please. 4 Take thou ourselves, O Lord, heart, mind, and will; through our surrendered souls thy plans fulfill. We yield ourselves to thee: time, talents, all; we hear, and henceforth heed, thy sovereign call. Informational Notes This hymn began with the tune, which the composer hummed to the author with a request for a text that would challenge the hearts and minds of young people. The text of the first three stanzas was written that day, and the fourth stanza later emerged at a youth conference.","1 Take thou our minds, dear Lord, we humbly pray; give us the mind of Christ each passing day; teach us to know the truth that sets us free; grant us in all our thoughts to honor thee. 2 Take thou our hearts, O Christ; they are thine own; come thou within our souls and claim thy throne; help us to shed abroad thy deathless love; use us to make the earth like heaven above. 3 Take thou our wills, Most High!

Informational Notes Each successive stanza here expands the implications of the familiar affirmation of the first one. Much more than a concern with money, stewardship shapes our relationship with God and with other people. Despite this tune’s name, no source has been found in Schumann’s works.","1 We give thee but thine own, whate'er the gift may be; all that we have is thine alone, a trust, O Lord, from thee. 2 May we thy bounties thus as stewards true receive, and gladly, as thou blessest us, to thee our firstfruits give. 3 The captive to release, to God the lost to bring, to teach the way of life and peace: it is a Christ-like thing. 4 And we believe thy word, though dim our faith may be; whate'er we do for thine, O Lord, we do it unto thee."

Teach us to show your abundant blessings. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, amen. Informational Notes This offertory acclamation was created by a Mennonite musician and draws on the simplicity and strength of a tradition accustomed to unaccompanied singing.  When sung as a canon, this acclamation simultaneously voices praises of God, prayers to God, and alleluias.","God, we honor you. God, we trust in you. God, we worship and adore you.

We lift our voices; we lift our hands; we lift our lives up to you: we are an offering; we are an offering. Informational Notes This praise and worship song can best be understood as reflecting on and expanding 1 Chronicles 29:14b: “For all things come of you, [O Lord,] and of your own have we given you.” There are also echoes of Paul’s appeal for Christians to be living sacrifices (Romans 12:1).","We lift our voices; we lift our hands; we lift our lives up to you: we are an offering. Lord, use our voices; Lord, use our hands; Lord, use our lives; they are yours: we are an offering. All that we have, all that we are, all that we hope to be, we give to you, we give to you.

Informational Notes A pastor wrote this text for a Christmas fair, which perhaps added echoes to the words “gifts” and “give” in the first two stanzas. But no hints are needed to grasp the full meaning of this hymn’s final line. The text is set to a shortened form of a widely used Genevan tune.","1 Lord of all good, our gifts we bring to you; use them your holy purpose to fulfill, tokens of love and pledges brought anew, that our whole life is offered to your will. 2 We give our minds to understand your ways; hands, eyes, and voice to serve your great design; heart with the flame of your own love ablaze, till for your glory all our powers combine. 3 Father, whose bounty all creation shows; Christ, by whose willing sacrifice we live; Spirit, from whom all life in fullness flows: to you with grateful hearts ourselves we give."

The church of Christ is calling us to make the dream come true: a world redeemed by Christ-like love, all life in Christ made new. 3 In gratitude and humble trust we bring our best today, to serve your cause and share your love with all along life’s way. O God who gave yourself to us in Jesus Christ your Son, help us to give ourselves each day until life's work is done. Informational Notes This text by a Presbyterian pastor in California expresses the conviction that being a good steward is an essential part of the Christian life, for self-giving is God’s own nature. The tune is named for the village in Surrey where the arranger collected this tune in 1903.","1 As those of old their firstfruits brought of vineyard, flock, and field to God, the giver of all good, the source of bounteous yield, so we today our firstfruits bring, the wealth of this good land: of farm and market, shop and home, of mind and heart and hand. 2 A world in need now summons us to labor, love, and give, to make our life an offering that all may truly live.

Informational Notes An Australian aboriginal saying opens this gentle hymn from New Zealand on the stewardship of creation. “Clouds of disaster” in the second stanza refers to the testing of nuclear devices then occurring in the Pacific Ocean, but the concern for all created things is timeless.","1 Touch the earth lightly, use the earth gently, nourish the life of the world in our care: gift of great wonder, ours to surrender, trust for the children tomorrow will bear. 2 We who endanger, who create hunger, agents of death for all creatures that live, we who would foster clouds of disaster, God of our planet, forestall and forgive! 3 Let there be greening, birth from the burning, water that blesses and air that is sweet, health in God’s garden, hope in God’s children, regeneration that peace will complete 4 God of all living, God of all loving, God of the seedling, the snow, and the sun, teach us, deflect us, Christ reconnect us, using us gently and making us one."

Guide all we say and do. Your will be done. Informational Notes Greater awareness has enlarged Christian stewardship to develop new dimensions of concern for people in all parts of the world. Because we believe that it is God’s will that the gifts we have received should be shared, this hymn concludes with that phrase from the Lord’s Prayer.","1 God of the fertile fields, shaper of earth that yields our daily bread: forth from your bounteous hand come gifts your love has planned, that all in every land be clothed and fed. 2 We would be stewards true, holding in trust from you all that you give; help us in love to share, teach us like you to care for people everywhere, that all may live. 3 As grows the hidden seed to fruit that serves our need, so your reign grows.

Give thanks wherever food is grown on borrowed holy land. 2 The fertile ground through years of toil has cried for Sabbath rest— a time of peace for worn-out soil so land can be refreshed. 3 All life belongs to God alone, in wilderness and fields. From fallow land, or plowed and sown, God gives the good it yields. 4 Till God endows the earth once more with Eden’s state of grace, may we endeavor to restore all land as sacred space. Informational Notes This text emerged from a study of the attention in Levitical laws to the well-being of the land, especially by calling for fallow periods, or “land sabbaths,” to preserve the soil. 2 Chronicles 36:21 even suggests that the Babylonian exile may have resulted from abusing the land.","1 The earth belongs to God alone; hard clay, rich soil, fine sand.

This text on stewardship was one of about 450 submissions in a search for such hymns conducted by the Hymn Society of America in 1961. These words are well grounded by their musical setting, an early American shape note tune named for a Baptist church in Harris County, Georgia.","1 God, whose giving knows no ending, from your rich and endless store, nature's wonder, Jesus' wisdom, costly cross, grave's shattered door: gifted by you, we turn to you, offering up ourselves in praise; thankful song shall rise forever, gracious donor of our days. 2 Skills and time are ours for pressing toward the goals of Christ, your Son: all at peace in health and freedom, races joined, the church made one.

Informational Notes The text was commissioned in 1987 by Fourth Presbyterian Church in Chicago, where it has continued to be used each Sunday as the offertory response. The triune activity of God as Creator (line 1), Savior (line 2), and Sustainer (line 7) enables and inspires our thanks and praise.","For the life that you have given, for the love in Christ made known, with these fruits of time and labor, with these gifts that are your own: here we offer, Lord, our praises; heart and mind and strength we bring; give us grace to love and serve you, living what we pray and sing."

Informational Notes Written by a nineteen-year-old in Connecticut, this challenging text has been widely printed on both sides of the Atlantic.

Informational Notes Two great truths inform this text: first, that the testimony of experience is powerful and persuasive; and second, that no one should venture to minister on one’s own strength rather than God’s. The tune reflects a 19th-century practice of adapting piano pieces as hymn tunes.","1 Lord, speak to me that I may speak in living echoes of your tone.

These have indeed been the marks of the faithful people of God always and everywhere, and the final stanza sums up our gratitude for them.","1 Give thanks for those whose faith is firm when all around seems bleak: on God’s good promise they rely, so while they live and when they die how forcefully they speak: the strong, who once were weak! 2 Give thanks for those whose hope is clear, beyond mere mortal sight: who seek the city God has planned, the true, eternal promised land, and steer on toward that light, a beacon ever bright. 3 Give thanks for those whose love is pure, a sparkling precious stone: they show by what they say and do an inward beauty, warm and true, for God’s concerns they own: God’s love through them is known. 4 Give thanks for saints of ages past and saints alive today: though often by this world despised, their hearts by God are richly prized. Give thanks that we may say we share their pilgrim way."

Their faith in acquiring the habit of prayer, their depth of adoring, Lord, help us to share. 2 Some march with events to turn them God's way; some need to withdraw, the better to pray; some carry the gospel through fire and through flood: our world is their parish; their purpose is God. 3 Rejoice in those saints, unpraised and unknown, who bear someone's cross, or shoulder their own; they share our complaining, our comforts, our cares: what patience in caring, what courage, is theirs! 4 Rejoice in God's saints, today and all days! A world without saints forgets how to praise. In loving, in living, they prove it is true: their way of self-giving, Lord, leads us to you. Informational Notes A more generally applicable version of a text written for the 600th anniversary of Julian of Norwich’s Revelations of Divine Love in 1973, this hymn uses a tune created for the Scotsman William Kethe’s paraphrase of Psalm 104, which appeared in several 16th-century psalters.","1 Rejoice in God's saints, today and all days!

Now let us be a vessel for God’s redeeming word. We all are one in mission; we all are one in call, our varied gifts united by Christ, the Lord of all. Informational Notes A Lutheran pastor wrote this text in response to a bishop’s letter that said, “Our mission is to touch the lives of others with Christ’s love.” This theme is made stronger by recognizing that shared purposes do not require the denial of diversity but are enriched by it.","1 We all are one in mission; we all are one in call, our varied gifts united by Christ, the Lord of all.

Informational Notes 737	Lord Jesus, You Shall Be My Song
Originally created in French, this text reflects the ministry of a Roman Catholic religious community, the Little Sisters of Jesus, who work with people on the margins of society. This hymn is also beloved by the Ark (L’Arche) communities who minister to adults with disabilities.","1 Lord Jesus, you shall be my song as I journey; I’ll tell everybody about you wherever I go: you alone are our life and our peace and our love.

Informational Notes In honestly admitting the limits of human ability, this prayerful hymn does not seek a sense of God’s presence for self-comfort but for strength and companionship in pursuing the tasks that God sets before us. The author specifically chose this tune to accompany his words.","1 O Master, let me walk with thee in lowly paths of service free; tell me thy secret; help me bear the strain of toil, the fret of care. 2 Help me the slow of heart to move by some clear, winning word of love; teach me the wayward feet to stay, and guide them in the homeward way. 3 Teach me thy patience, still with thee in closer, dearer company, in work that keeps faith sweet and strong, in trust that triumphs over wrong. 4 In hope that sends a shining ray far down the future's broadening way; in peace that only thou canst give, with thee, O Master, let me live."

Informational Notes Merely longing for a restored relationship with God is not enough; real repentance requires amendment of life (stanza 3). The similarity of stanzas one and four suggests both continuity and improvement. This tune was one of the new common tunes in the Scottish Psalter of 1635.","1 O for a closer walk with God, a calm and heavenly frame, a light to shine upon the road that leads me to the Lamb! 2 Return, O holy Dove, return, sweet messenger of rest!

Lead me, O Lord, lead me.    (Refrain) Informational Notes This African American gospel hymn can well be understood as an updated adaptation of Psalm 5:8, with the “enemies” of the psalm treated as the pressures and temptations of daily life. As with the psalms, the “I” here is understood to express a shared communal experience.","Refrain: Lead me, guide me, along the way, for if you lead me, I cannot stray.

Informational Notes Though this refrain from a longer song is not a paraphrase of any particular psalm, the language in the first six lines has definite scriptural overtones (such as Psalms 31:14, 5:3; Deuteronomy 26:17). The final two lines sound more spontaneous and lead to a confident conclusion.","O God, you are my God, and I will ever praise you. O God, you are my God, and I will ever praise you.

All you in sorrow born, bind up the brokenhearted ones and comfort those who mourn. 4 Arise, your light is come! The mountains burst in song! Rise up like eagles on the wing; God's power will make us strong. Informational Notes Echoing imagery from Isaiah 61:1–2 and other passages, this text was created as an inclusive-language alternative to an older hymn using this late 19th-century tune. Because it is a song of encouragement rather than a song of praise, it is not directed to God but to people.","1 Arise, your light is come!

Where there is injury, your pardon, Lord, and where there’s doubt, true faith in you. 2 Make me a channel of your peace. Where there’s despair in life, let me bring hope. Where there is darkness, only light, and where there’s sadness, ever joy. 3 O, Master, grant that I may never seek so much to be consoled as to console, to be understood as to understand, to be loved as to love with all my soul. 4 Make me a channel of your peace. It is in pardoning that we are pardoned, in giving of ourselves that we receive, and in dying that we’re born to eternal life. Informational Notes Though popular opinion credits this prayer to Francis of Assisi, the earliest known printing was in a French religious magazine in 1912. Yet that gentle saint’s spirit seems evident in these words, a quality that has spurred many paraphrases and musical settings such as this one.","1 Make me a channel of your peace.

Be present, Lord, among us and bring us to believe we are ourselves accepted, and meant to love and live. 2 Teach us, O Lord, your lessons, as in our daily life we struggle to be human and search for hope and faith. Teach us to care for people, for all, not just for some, to love them as we find them, or as they may become. 3 Let your acceptance change us, so that we may be moved in living situations to do the truth in love; to practice your acceptance until we know by heart the table of forgiveness, and laughter’s healing art. 4 Lord, for today’s encounters with all who are in need, who hunger for acceptance, for justice and for bread, we need new eyes for seeing, new hands for holding on: renew us with your Spirit; Lord, free us; make us one! Informational Notes The scriptural basis of this text is Romans 15:7, recast as a prayer in the opening two lines of the first stanza. The many implications of living as people who have been accepted by Christ fill the remaining stanzas. This tune was composed for the first publication of this text.","1 Help us accept each other as Christ accepted us; teach us as sister, brother, each person to embrace.

Informational Notes Psalms 111 and 112 are appropriately brought together in this paraphrase. Both form acrostics: each poetic line begins with a letter of the Hebrew alphabet in order. In addition, both psalms begin with “hallelujah,” and they share much vocabulary as well as a theme of praise.","1 Alleluia!

Informational Notes If we truly believe that God cares for all people, we cannot limit our prayers and songs for peace to the welfare of our own nation, no matter how much we may love it. This challenging text is set to a stirring Welsh tune, named for a hamlet with a prominent Baptist chapel.","1 O God of every nation, of every race and land, redeem the whole creation with your almighty hand.

But we are vain and sadly proud; we sow not peace but strife. Our discord spreads a deadly cloud that threatens all of life. 3 Pray justice may come rolling down as in a mighty stream, with righteousness in field and town to cleanse us and redeem. For God is longing to restore an earth where conflicts cease, a world that was created for a harmony of peace. 4 May we in service to our God act out the living word, and walk the road the saints have trod till all have seen and heard. As stewards of the earth may we give thanks in one accord to God who calls us all to be disciples of the Lord. Informational Notes This text placing stewardship in the context of faithful witness was written by a retired Presbyterian minister to be part of the 1986 stewardship campaign titled “Called to Be Disciples.” The tune name recalls the Sussex village where the arranger first heard the melody.","1 Today we all are called to be disciples of the Lord, to help to set the captive free, make plowshare out of sword, to feed the hungry, quench their thirst, make love and peace our fast, to serve the poor and homeless first, our ease and comfort last. 2 God made the world and at its birth ordained our human race to live as stewards of the earth, responding to God's grace.

Rulers of earth’s vast dominions light the skies with martyrs’ fire. Truth mistaken, God forsaken, banes of righteousness arise; yet shall they reap sore displeasure, sure defeat before God’s eyes. 2 To the children of the promise God shall give the throne this day. With a scepter forged of iron, they shall dash their foes as clay: faith revealing, humbly kneeling, quench the fire and sheathe the sword, for God’s wrath is quickly kindled; blest are they who serve the Lord. Informational Notes In this concise paraphrase of Psalm 2, the first stanza describes a political struggle from a human perspective, while the second stanza describes how the matter is resolved through God’s power. The frequent three-note figures in this Welsh tune help to convey a sense of turmoil.","1 Why do nations rage together; why in vain do they conspire?

Informational Notes Rather than treating racism as a societal problem, this text considers the issue from a theological point of view. When we distance ourselves from other people merely because of the color of their skin, we fail to honor their God-likeness and to see Christ’s image in them.","1 O God, we bear the imprint of your face: the colors of our skin are your design, and what we have of beauty in our race as man or woman, you alone define, who stretched a living fabric on our frame and gave to each a language and a name. 2 Where we are torn and pulled apart by hate because our race, our skin is not the same, while we are judged unequal by the state and victims made because we own our name, humanity reduced to little worth, dishonored is your living face on earth. 3 O God, we share the image of the One whose flesh and blood are ours, whatever skin; in Christ’s humanity we find our own, and in his family our proper kin: Christ is the brother we still crucify, his love the language we must learn, or die."

Informational Notes This text affirms that the images we use for God can be inspired by either gender because both males and females reflect the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:27). Similarly, since God is with us at all stages of life, all ages hold the potential to reveal something about God.","1 Bring many names, beautiful and good, celebrate, in parable and story, holiness in glory, living, loving God.

Where charity and love are found, there can the church be known.

Informational Notes The image of a great feast showing God’s welcome of all people was part of Jewish tradition (Isaiah 25:6–9) and underlies Jesus’ parable of the Great Banquet (Luke 14:15–24). Such equality remains as unknown to many people today as it was to the slaves who created this spiritual.","1 I’m gonna eat at the welcome table; I’m gonna eat at the welcome table, Alleluia.

Mustard seeds grow more than we can conceive: roots thread the soil; branches reach for the sun. This is how God moves us each to believe. 2 What is the world like when God's will is done? Witness the wandering child coming home; watch as the parent breaks into a run. This is how God longs for us when we roam. 3 What is the world like when God's will is done? No more is neighbor just ally or friend; peace thrives in places where once there was none. This is how God works when rivalries end. 4 What is the world like when God's will is done? Ready for feasting, we watch through the night, tending our lamps till the new day's begun. This is how God readies us for the light. 5 These are the stories that Jesus imparts, filled with the Spirit who joins us as one. Born through our voices, our hands, and our hearts, this is a new world where God's will is done. Informational Notes This text and tune were written to conclude a hymn festival at the 2009 Annual Conference of The Hymn Society in the United States and Canada. Four parables framed both the festival and the hymn: the Mustard Seed, the Prodigal Son, the Good Samaritan, and the Ten Bridesmaids.","1 What is the world like when God's will is done?

The oppressed shall be the first to see the year of God's own jubilee! 2 Live into hope! The blind shall see with insight and with clarity, removing shades of pride and fear, a vision of our God brought near. 3 Live into hope of liberty, the right to speak, the right to be, the right to have one's daily bread, to hear God's word and thus be fed. 4 Live into hope of captives freed from chains of fear or want or greed. God now proclaims our full release to faith and hope and joy and peace. Informational Notes This text on Luke 4:16–20, the author’s first, was written for the United Presbyterian Women’s National Meeting in July 1976 because the team planning worship could not find a suitable hymn on that passage. She wrote the words with this vigorous 18th-century tune in mind.","1 Live into hope of captives freed, of sight regained, the end of greed.

Informational Notes This stirring, prophetic hymn is organized around two recurring four-syllable phrases, the first of which introduces an idealized scenario of what Dietrich Bonhoeffer would call “cheap grace,” while the second announces the “costly grace” of God’s redeeming work in Jesus Christ.","1 Heaven shall not wait for the poor to lose their patience, the scorned to smile, the despised to find a friend: Jesus is Lord; he has championed the unwanted; in him injustice confronts its timely end. 2 Heaven shall not wait for the rich to share their fortunes, the proud to fall, the elite to tend the least: Jesus is Lord; he has shown the master's privilege: to kneel and wash servants' feet before they feast. 3 Heaven shall not wait for the dawn of great ideas, thoughts of compassion divorced from cries of pain: Jesus is Lord; he has married word and action; his cross and company make his purpose plain. 4 Heaven shall not wait for triumphant Hallelujahs, when earth has passed and we reach another shore: Jesus is Lord in our present imperfection; his power and love are for now and then for evermore."

Sing, with thanks and adoration, to the God of endless life! Informational Notes At the center of this text stands a reference to the well-known parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11–32), and the fourth stanza forms an effective bridge between that gospel story and the celebration of the Lord’s Supper. The first and last stanzas draw on 2 Corinthians 5:17.","1 There is now a new creation through the grace of Jesus Christ, peace and reconciliation with the God of endless life. 2 Call the lost and found together; tell the news to everyone: now the past is gone forever and a new life has begun. 3 Wrap the prodigal in welcome; run to greet the wayward child.

Informational Notes The two equal phrases in each line here suggest that this African American spiritual shares some characteristics of work or field songs that were used to coordinate the efforts of slaves involved in tasks (road clearing, ditch digging, etc.) that needed combined rhythmic strokes.","1 I want Jesus to walk with me; I want Jesus to walk with me; all along my pilgrim journey, Lord, I want Jesus to walk with me. 2 In my trials, Lord, walk with me; in my trials, Lord, walk with me; when my heart is almost breaking, Lord, I want Jesus to walk with me. 3 When I’m in trouble, Lord, walk with me; when I’m in trouble, Lord, walk with me; when my head is bowed in sorrow, Lord, I want Jesus to walk with me."

Come, set your faithful servant free; I call upon your name! 3 When terror wakes me from my dreams and shakes me through and through, teach me to pray with confidence and put my trust in you. 4 Some fear that you will not provide; they cry, “Show us your face!” But you have satisfied my heart with goodness, joy, and grace. 5 Now lay me down to sleep in peace; in safety let me rest. O God, within your loving care I am forever blessed. Informational Notes This paraphrase of Psalm 4 speaks to us across the ages with a problem we also know: lack of sleep caused by worry and fear. Yet there is hope, because God is gracious and calms our fearful hearts, giving us the peace that allows us to find rest even in the midst of trying times.","1 O God, be gracious; hear my prayer, and answer when I cry.

My heart is overwhelmed with grief, by evil night and day! 3 How long, O Lord?  But you forgive with mercy from above. I find that all your ways are just; I learn to praise you and to trust in your unfailing love! Informational Notes This paraphrase of Psalm 13 convincingly captures the psalm’s initial sense of self-centered desperation. Then, like sunlight breaking through clouds of despair, this mood is suddenly dispelled by an awareness of God’s mercy and love, which is so much greater than we can imagine.","How Long, O Lord (Psalm 13) 1 How long, O Lord, will you forget an answer to my prayer?

With shouting pilgrims I will come to climb your holy hill. Then with the harp I'll sing your praise; my happy voice I'll raise. 	(Refrain) Informational Notes Because they share vocabulary, themes, and a refrain, Psalms 42 and 43 are regarded as one extended prayer for help. Although cast as the voice of one person, this is really the plea of the whole Jewish people longing to return from exile and to worship once more in Jerusalem.","1 As pants the deer for living streams, in dry or desert space, I thirst for you, O living God; I long to see your face!

779,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create How Long, O God, Will My Prayers Be in Vain? Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 How long, O God, will my prayers be in vain? Why must I languish in sorrow and pain? Do not abandon a child you have made; you are my shelter, my solace and shade. 2 When evil prospers and hope is long gone, do not forsake me, your presence withdrawn. Shield and protect those who call on your name; you are my God, and your blessing I claim. 3 Early and late will my tongue sing your praise; you will uphold me the length of my days. You are a stronghold for all the oppressed; hear us, O God! Let your people be blessed. Informational Notes This text does not paraphrase any specific psalm, but it adopts the vocabulary and the structure of many psalms. The first two stanzas begin with a sense of abandonment and despair, which is countered by remembrance of God’s nature. This memory leads to a final stanza of praise.","1 How long, O God, will my prayers be in vain? Why must I languish in sorrow and pain? Do not abandon a child you have made; you are my shelter, my solace and shade. 2 When evil prospers and hope is long gone, do not forsake me, your presence withdrawn.

May those who love your saving power say evermore, “Exalt the Lord!” 3 Yet I am poor and needy, Lord; be quick to hear my urgent plea. You are my help, my Savior God! Do not delay; remember me. Informational Notes While this paraphrase is short, so is Psalm 70, which has only five verses and is almost identical to Psalm 40:13–17. This brief prayer for deliverance from enemies and blessing on the faithful is often used during Holy Week because of its parallels with Christ’s suffering.","1 Come quickly, Lord, to rescue me, and hasten to my help, I pray. May all who seek to take my life be put to shame without delay. 2 May all who seek your name rejoice, your praise in gratitude record.

My heart breaks in deep despair; my soul longs to hold you here. 2 You, O God, once walked beside me. In the night your songs revived me. Were your promises in vain? Will you smile on me again? Long ago you brought redemption; your right hand won our salvation. I remember deeds of old: now, remember me, O Lord! 3 All creation bows before you; saints in earth and heaven adore you. Thunder roars and torrents fall at your word, O God of all! In our grief, you stand beside us, there to lift us, and to guide us, unseen savior of our days, heir to endless songs of praise! Informational Notes The growing confidence in this paraphrase of Psalm 77 is signaled by the movement from “me” to “us”; recalling the shared history of God’s people is a source of comfort and hope. Such remembering is also evident in the musical setting that uses the Genevan tune for this psalm.","1 Hear my cry, O God, and save me! Troubles and distress enslave me. Day and night I seek your face, yearning for your light and grace. But these eyes: they cannot see you; outstretched arms: they cannot feel you.

Judge me not, I pray; no merit dare I claim; knowing my own faults, I trust in your just Name. 2 Hounded by a foe who crushed me to the ground, I am like the dead or those in prison bound. Hopeless, numbed by fear, I ponder all your care; thirsty as parched earth, I lift my hands in prayer. 3 Answer soon, O God; my spirit faints in me; do not hide your face, or I will cease to be. When the morning dawns, make known your love anew; show me how to walk, for I will trust in you. 4 Keep me safe, O God, and help me learn your will; let your Spirit lead through level pathways still. For your great Name’s sake, my griefs and fears dispel; free me from my foes, that I may serve you well. Informational Notes This text is a 21st-century paraphrase of Psalm 143, the last of the seven penitential psalms. Internal references suggest that the original psalm was associated with a night of prayer in the Temple. It is set to a chant-like tune composed especially for these words.","1 Hear my prayer, O God, and listen to my plea; faithful, righteous One, give ear and answer me. Judge me not, I pray; no merit dare I claim; knowing my own faults, I trust in your just Name. 2 Hounded by a foe who crushed me to the ground, I am like the dead or those in prison bound.

783,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create When We Are Tested Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 When we are tested and wrestle alone, famished for bread when the world offers stone, nourish us, God, by your word and your way, food that sustains us by night and by day. 2 When in the desert we cry for relief, pleading for paths marked by certain belief, lift us to love you beyond sign and test, trusting your presence, our only true rest. 3 When we are tempted to barter our souls, trading the truth for the power to control, teach us to worship and praise only you, seeking your will in the work that we do. 4 When we have struggled and searched through the night, sorting and sifting the wrong from the right, Savior, surround us with circles of care, angels of healing, of hope, and of prayer. Informational Notes Although the Temptation of Christ is mentioned in all three synoptic gospels (Matthew 4:1–11/Mark 1:12–13/Luke 4:1–13), this hymn is based on the Lukan version. It is notable that each stanza begins “when,” not “if”; temptation is not an optional feature of the spiritual life.","1 When we are tested and wrestle alone, famished for bread when the world offers stone, nourish us, God, by your word and your way, food that sustains us by night and by day. 2 When in the desert we cry for relief, pleading for paths marked by certain belief, lift us to love you beyond sign and test, trusting your presence, our only true rest. 3 When we are tempted to barter our souls, trading the truth for the power to control, teach us to worship and praise only you, seeking your will in the work that we do. 4 When we have struggled and searched through the night, sorting and sifting the wrong from the right, Savior, surround us with circles of care, angels of healing, of hope, and of prayer."

We remember, we remember, we remember Zion. Informational Notes This canonic setting of a paraphrase of Psalm 137:1 gains much of its power from simple but profound patterns, especially the first two lines that descend like vocal tears. By contrast the phrases of the final line move upward, affirming that memory rebuilds what has fallen.","By the waters, the waters of Babylon, we sat down and wept, and wept for Zion. We remember, we remember, we remember Zion."
785,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create In Deepest Night Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 In deepest night, in darkest days, when harps are hung, no songs we raise, when silence must suffice as praise, yet sounding in us quietly there is the song of God. 2 When friend was lost, when love deceived, dear Jesus wept, God was bereaved; so with us in our grief God grieves, and round about us mournfully there are the tears of God. 3 When through the waters winds our path, around us pain, around us death, deep calls to deep, a saving breath, and found beside us faithfully there is the love of God. Informational Notes If we are honest about the range of human experience, not everything we sing in church can be loud or joyful. The author describes this hymn as “a song of quiet hope in the middle of intense sorrow.” It speaks eloquently of God’s presence with us through our most difficult times.","1 In deepest night, in darkest days, when harps are hung, no songs we raise, when silence must suffice as praise, yet sounding in us quietly there is the song of God. 2 When friend was lost, when love deceived, dear Jesus wept, God was bereaved; so with us in our grief God grieves, and round about us mournfully there are the tears of God. 3 When through the waters winds our path, around us pain, around us death, deep calls to deep, a saving breath, and found beside us faithfully there is the love of God."

The proud, unbridled, chase the poor, and curse you in their greed. 2 Why do you hide when, full of lies, they murder and betray? They wait to pounce upon the weak as lions stalk their prey. 3 The weak are crushed and fall to earth; the wicked strut and preen. Why in these cruel, chaotic times cannot your face be seen? 4 In ages past you heard the voice of those the proud oppress. Remember those who suffer now, who cry in deep distress. 5 Arise, O God, and lift your hand; bring justice to the poor. Come, help us stop the flow of blood! Let terror reign no more! Informational Notes This paraphrase of Psalm 10 is striking in its timeless questions and its keen sense of being abandoned by God. The injustice, oppression, and fear it describes resonate with the state of the world in our own day. Like the ancient psalmist, we pray for God to end the reign of terror.","1 Why stand so far away, my God? Why hide in times of need? The proud, unbridled, chase the poor, and curse you in their greed. 2 Why do you hide when, full of lies, they murder and betray?

Informational Notes This hymn especially appropriate for funerals began as a wordless tune composed upon reading the obituary of Thomas Layton Moshier, a friend who died from AIDS. Several months later the tune was sent to the author, who created this text incorporating a reference to Romans 12:15.","1 God weeps with us who weep and mourn; God’s tears flow down with ours, and God’s own heart is bruised and worn from all the heavy hours of watching while the soul’s bright fire burned lower day by day, and pulse and breath and love’s desire dimmed down to ash and clay. 2 Through tears and sorrow, God, we share a sense of your vast grief: the weight of bearing every prayer for healing and relief, the burden of our questions why, the doubts that they engage, and as our friends and loved ones die, our hopelessness and rage. 3 And yet because, like us, you weep, we trust you will receive and in your tender heart will keep the ones for whom we grieve, while with your tears our hearts will taste the deep, dear core of things from which both life and death are graced by love’s renewing springs."

Too long have we been mocked and scorned, derided by the proud and strong. Informational Notes Psalm 123 is one of several “songs of ascents,” likely sung by Jewish pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem for one of the three great annual feasts: Passover, Weeks, and Booths. As this paraphrase suggests, these were short psalms that could be easily memorized and sung together.","1 To you, O Lord, we lift our eyes, to you enthroned in heaven above; as servants wait for those they serve, so we look up and wait God’s love. 2 Have mercy on us now, O Lord; contempt has been our lot too long. Too long have we been mocked and scorned, derided by the proud and strong."

(Refrain) Informational Notes Claimed by both Pakistanis and Indians, this is one of the most popular South Asian hymns. The text represents a Christian adaptation of Psalm 61, and the psalm’s theme is reinforced by the mantra-like repetition of the word “saranam,” meaning “I take refuge” or “surrender.”","Refrain: Jesus, Savior, Lord, now to you I come.

My enemies may chase me down; love shields me from their hate. Refrain: God is my rock; God is my strength; God is my salvation, my refuge, my abiding peace.

(Refrain) 3 In quietness my Lord conferred two truths I now declare: no greater love than God’s is known; no power can compare.	(Refrain) Informational Notes Psalm 62 is usually described as a song of confidence or trust, and that emphasis is made especially clear by the recurring refrain of this paraphrase. Its affirmations also serve as a testimony intended to lead others to make the same commitment to rely on God’s steadfast love.","1 In silence my soul thirsts for God; for God alone I wait. My enemies may chase me down; love shields me from their hate. Refrain: God is my rock; God is my strength; God is my salvation, my refuge, my abiding peace.

791,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create For You, My God, I Wait Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 For you, my God, I wait with hope born of the Word. Like sleepless ones who long to dream I wait and call my Lord. 2 Lord, hear my pleading voice, and let me know you hear! As sleepless ones feel rest approach, I know my God is near. 3 If you should list my faults, the sins of heart and hand, like sleepless ones who groan at dawn I know I could not stand! 4 For even from the deep I know you hear my cries. Like sleepless ones who dream at last, I ease my weary eyes. 5 And once my soul is still, in you I find my rest, at peace as though a child upon a gentle mother’s breast. 6 O God, you are my hope; I know that you forgive. Your love redeems me from the depths so I may rise and live. Informational Notes Unlike most paraphrases of Psalm 130, this one begins in the thematic center of the psalm and works backwards to the familiar “out of the depths” language of the opening verse. This focus on waiting allows the paraphrase to incorporate the imagery of the brief related Psalm 131.","1 For you, my God, I wait with hope born of the Word. Like sleepless ones who long to dream I wait and call my Lord. 2 Lord, hear my pleading voice, and let me know you hear! As sleepless ones feel rest approach, I know my God is near. 3 If you should list my faults, the sins of heart and hand, like sleepless ones who groan at dawn I know I could not stand! 4 For even from the deep I know you hear my cries.

(Refrain) 3 If you cannot preach like Peter, if you cannot pray like Paul, you can tell the love of Jesus and say, “He died for all.”	(Refrain) Informational Notes This African American spiritual offers a long-delayed answer to the prophet Jeremiah’s question, “Is there no balm in Gilead?” (Jeremiah 8:22).  No earthly remedy can compare with the healing that comes from a sense of God’s presence; nothing else can heal “the sin-sick soul.”","Refrain: There is a balm in Gilead to make the wounded whole; there is a balm in Gilead to heal the sin-sick soul. 1 Sometimes I feel discouraged, and think my work’s in vain, but then the Holy Spirit revives my soul again.

Informational Notes 794	O Savior, in This Quiet Place

This prayer for healing was written for the ecumenical St. Barnabas Counseling Centre in Norwich, England. As hymns often do, it provides a model for how to pray honestly but not selfishly. It is set to a tune by an Anglican clergyman who wrote on scientific and musical matters.","1 O Savior, in this quiet place, where anyone may kneel, I also come to ask for grace, believing you can heal. 2 If pain of body, stress of mind, destroys my inward peace, in prayer for others may I find the secret of release. 3 If self upon its sickness feeds and turns my life to gall, let me not brood upon my needs, but simply tell you all. 4 You never said “You ask too much” to any troubled soul.

Informational Notes As soon becomes apparent, this sung prayer is not limited to personal physical healing. It deals with the larger and intangible gifts of peace and hope to vanquish fear and sorrow, and it is cast in the plural because it is concerned with the healing of a wounded community.","Refrain: Healer of our every ill, light of each tomorrow, give us peace beyond our fear, and hope beyond our sorrow. 1You who know our fears and sadness, grace us with your peace and gladness; Spirit of all comfort, fill our hearts. 2 In the pain and joy beholding how your grace is still unfolding, give us all your vision, God of love. 3 Give us strength to love each other, every sister, every brother; Spirit of all kindness, be our guide. 4 You who know each thought and feeling, teach us all your way of healing; Spirit of compassion, fill each heart."

Informational Notes Unlike many hymns on the theme of healing, this text appropriately includes the ministry of medical personnel as instruments of God’s healing activity. It also acknowledges that illness is not limited to physical symptoms, but involves mental, emotional, and spiritual dimensions.","1 We come to you for healing, Lord, of body, mind, and soul, and pray that by your Spirit’s touch we may again be whole. 2 As once you walked through ancient streets and reached toward those in pain, we know you come among us still with power to heal again. 3 You touch us through physicians’ skills, through nurses’ gifts of care, and through the love of faithful friends who lift our lives in prayer. 4 Through nights of pain and wakefulness, through days when strength runs low, grant us your gift of patience, Lord, your calming peace to know. 5 We come to you, O loving Lord, in our distress and pain, in trust that through our nights and days your grace will heal, sustain."

Your hands, though bloodied on the cross, survive to hold and heal and warn, to carry all through death to life and cradle children yet unborn. 2 The pain that will not go away, the guilt that clings from things long past, the fear of what the future holds, are present as if meant to last. But present too is love which tends the hurt we never hoped to find, the private agonies inside, the memories that haunt the mind. 3 So some have come who need your help and some have come to make amends, as hands which shaped and saved the world are present in the touch of friends. Lord, let your Spirit meet us here to mend the body, mind, and soul, to disentangle peace from pain, and make your broken people whole. Informational Notes This 20th-century text from the Iona Community grapples with the realities of illness and pain, not only as they afflict the body but even more as they lay waste to mind and soul. The traditional folk melody helps to convey the sort of communal experience assumed in the last stanza.","1 We cannot measure how you heal or answer every sufferer’s prayer, yet we believe your grace responds where faith and doubt unite to care.

Informational Notes This is one of the few hymns rooted in what can happen during worship, and that experience—gaining a spiritual insight while singing—is no less possible now than when this text was written in the 18th century. It is set here to a folk song variously labeled Irish or English.","1 Sometime a light surprises the child of God who sings; it is the Lord who rises with healing in his wings; when comforts are declining, he grants the soul again a season of clear shining to cheer it after rain. 2 In holy contemplation we sweetly then pursue the theme of God’s salvation and find it ever new; set free from present sorrow, we cheerfully can say, “Let the unknown tomorrow bring with it what it may.” 3 It can bring with it nothing but he will bear us through; who gives the lilies clothing will clothe his people, too; beneath the spreading heavens no creature but is fed; and he who feeds the ravens will give his children bread. 4 Though vine nor fig tree neither their longed-for fruit should bear, though all the fields should wither, nor flocks nor herds be there, yet God the same abiding, his praise shall tune my voice; for while in him confiding, I cannot but rejoice."

Informational Notes Since its creation in the mid-19th century, this text has been one of the favorite paraphrases of Psalm 23 in the English-speaking world. That popularity increased in the early 20th century when The English Hymnal, 1906, first joined these words to this flowing Irish melody.","1 The King of love my shepherd is, whose goodness faileth never; I nothing lack if I am his and he is mine forever. 2 Where streams of living water flow my ransomed soul he leadeth, and where the verdant pastures grow, with food celestial feedeth. 3 Perverse and foolish oft I strayed, but yet in love he sought me, and on his shoulder gently laid, and home, rejoicing, brought me. 4 In death's dark vale I fear no ill with thee, dear Lord, beside me; thy rod and staff my comfort still, thy cross before to guide me. 5 Thou spread’st a table in my sight; thy unction grace bestoweth; and O what transport of delight from thy pure chalice floweth! 6 And so through all the length of days thy goodness faileth never; Good Shepherd, may I sing thy praise within thy house forever."

There would I find a settled rest, while others go and come; no more a stranger, or a guest, but like a child at home. Informational Notes The effectiveness of this beloved paraphrase of Psalm 23 owes much to the flowing shape note melody that serves as a “living stream” to carry the text, which in turn has been given a remarkable clarity and lightness through the poet’s masterful use of single-syllable words.","1 My shepherd will supply my need; Jehovah is his name.

Informational Notes This paraphrase of Psalm 146 was a great favorite of John Wesley: it appeared in his first hymn collection in 1737 (published in Charleston, South Carolina) and was on his lips when he died. The 16th-century tune to which it is set here is the one Watts had in mind for it.","1 I'll praise my Maker while I've breath; and when my voice is lost in death, praise shall employ my nobler powers.

Informational Notes Corresponding to Psalm 16:7–11, these five stanzas celebrating God’s guidance and protection formed the second half of a paraphrase of the full psalm in their original publication. These words are set to a 16th-century psalm tune that has been effective with many texts.","1 When in the night I meditate on mercies multiplied, my grateful heart inspires my tongue to bless the Lord, my guide. 2 Forever in my thought, the Lord before my face shall stand; secure, unmoved I shall remain, with God at my right hand. 3 My inmost being thrills with joy and gladness fills my breast; because on God my trust is stayed, my flesh in hope shall rest. 4 I know that I shall not be left forgotten in the grave, and from corruption, you, O Lord, your holy one will save. 5 The path of life you show to me; of joy a boundless store is ever found at your right hand, and pleasures evermore."

Mas yo en ti, Jehová, confío; digo: “¡Tú eres mi Dios. En tu mano están mis tiempos! Tú eres me Dios.” Informational Notes These selected verses of Psalm 31 are slightly reordered here (as 16, 14–15) to give initial emphasis to the petition for God’s favor, expressed in the typical Hebraic image of a radiant face. That plea is then reinforced by affirmations of the psalmist’s unwavering trust in God.","Make your face to shine upon your servant, and in your loving-kindness save me.

From their designs, my life redeem through grace which cannot fail. 3 My sacrifice I offer you as thanks for all your grace. Let me so live that I in death may greet you face to face. Informational Notes The three stanzas of this paraphrase nicely condense all seven verses of Psalm 54 and trace its movement from an appeal for help, through a statement of hope amid adversity, to a vow of thanksgiving. The words are set to an early American shape note tune that gives them urgency.","1 O save me, God, and hear my cry: my prayer to you ascends.

Show once more that you are God: raise me from despair! Then my soul will sing your name, praise your steadfast care. Informational Notes The delicacy of the Japanese melody adds to the sense of isolation and vulnerability in this 21st-century paraphrase of Psalm 71. Yet the prayerful tone shows that a lifetime of trust has taught the psalmist to be confident of God’s steadfast care, a theme worth singing about.","1 God, my help and hiding place, rescue me from shame.

Informational Notes This prayer response based on Psalm 62:1, 5 comes from the ecumenical community in Taizé, France (see also no. 843). It is intended for repeated singing in either language (or both). It can also be used effectively as a recurring congregational response in a series of prayers.","In God alone my soul can find rest and peace, in God my peace and joy.

So shalt thou, wondering, own God’s way, how wise, how strong God’s hand! 4 Let us in life, in death, thy steadfast truth declare, and publish with our final breath thy love and guardian care. Informational Notes This text uses selected stanzas from sixteen four-line English stanzas based on the original German text, which was twice as long. The German hymn was constructed as an acrostic on Martin Luther’s translation of Psalm 37:5, and much of the spirit of that psalm is retained here.","1 Give to the winds thy fears; hope, and be undismayed.

Trust the rich promises of grace; so shall they be fulfilled in thee. God never yet forsook at need the soul secured by trust indeed. Informational Notes This hymn is a testimony of experience. The original seven-stanza German text (based on Psalm 55:22) and its tune were created by the author/composer at the age of twenty in thanksgiving for finding employment many weeks after being left almost penniless following a robbery.","1 If thou but trust in God to guide thee, with hopeful heart through all thy ways, God will give strength, whate'er betide thee, to bear thee through the evil days.

Informational Notes The opening line here is essentially a quotation of 2 Corinthians 5:7, but that affirmation is fleshed out by references to the appearance of the risen Christ to Thomas (John 20:19–29). The shape note tune, named for a stream in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, adds resolution to the words.","1 We walk by faith and not by sight; with gracious words draw near, O Christ, who spoke as none e'er spoke: “My peace be with you here.” 2 We may not touch your hands and side, nor follow where you trod; but in your promise we rejoice, and cry, ""My Lord and God!"" 3 Help then, O Lord, our unbelief; and may our faith abound to call on you when you are near and seek where you are found. 4 And when our life of faith is done, in realms of clearer light may we behold you as you are, with full and endless sight."

Informational Notes This text (made from the author’s last poem) turns in the middle of stanza 2, where broad affirmations yield to a prayer continuing through the rest of the hymn, a prayer that testifies to deep confidence. The minor tune helps to convey such tensions in the life of faith.","1 By gracious powers so wonderfully sheltered, and confidently waiting, come what may, we know that God is with us night and morning and never fails to greet us each new day. 2 Yet is this heart by its old foe tormented, still evil days bring burdens hard to bear; O give our frightened souls the sure salvation for which, O Lord, you taught us to prepare. 3 And when this cup you give is filled to brimming with bitter suffering, hard to understand, we take it thankfully and without trembling, out of so good and so beloved a hand. 4 Yet when again in this same world you give us the joy we had, the brightness of your sun, we shall remember all the days we lived through, and our whole life shall then be yours alone."

Informational Notes This meditative text seems to be rooted in Psalm 46:10, “Be still and know that I am God,” while also reaching forward to 1 Thessalonians 4:17b , “we will be with the Lord forever.” Much of the appeal of this hymn comes from its tune, named for the tone poem on which it is based.","1 Be still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side.

Informational Notes Reversing the usual pattern, the tune came first in this hymn; the tune name was assigned only after the text was written. The author first heard the repeated phrase “or/not even death” implied by the melody, which sent her to the passage from Romans 8:31–39 paraphrased here.","1 Shall tribulation or distress, shall persecution, fire, or sword, or any peril of this world— or even death, or even death— shall any power of earth or heaven divide us from your love, O Christ? 2 Shall illness, hunger, or despair, shall lonely grief or anxious fears, or deeds of hatred and disdain— or even death, or even death— shall any power of earth or heaven divide us from your love, O Christ? 3 No, neither angel hosts nor thrones, nor height nor depth of evil’s reach, nor present things, nor things to come— not even death, not even death— not any power of earth or heaven can part us from your love, O Christ."

This is my earnest plea: more love, O Christ, to thee; more love to thee, more love to thee! 2 Once earthly joy I craved, sought peace and rest. Now thee alone I seek; give what is best. This all my prayer shall be: more love, O Christ, to thee; more love to thee, more love to thee! 3 Then shall my latest breath whisper thy praise; this be the parting cry my heart shall raise. This still its prayer shall be: more love, O Christ, to thee; more love to thee, more love to thee! Informational Notes Perhaps because this prayer-poem by the wife of a leading 19th-century Presbyterian minister grew out of her own physical and emotional suffering, it has continued to speak to many people in similar distress. It is set here to the tune created for its first printing in a hymnal.","1 More love to thee, O Christ, more love to thee! Hear thou the prayer I make on bended knee.

Now hear me while I pray; take all my guilt away; O let me from this day be wholly thine! 2 May thy rich grace impart strength to my fainting heart, my zeal inspire; as thou hast died for me, O may my love to thee pure, warm, and changeless be, a living fire! 3 While life’s dark maze I tread and griefs around me spread, be thou my guide; bid darkness turn to day; wipe sorrow’s tears away; nor let me ever stray from thee aside. 4 When ends life’s transient dream, when death’s cold, sullen stream shall o’er me roll; blest Savior, then, in love, fear and distrust remove; O bear me safe above, a ransomed soul! Informational Notes Originally a poem of private reflection, this text was offered to the composer when he asked the author if he had written anything that could be set to music for a new hymn and tune collection. This was the first tune written for these words and has proved the most enduring.","1 My faith looks up to thee, thou Lamb of Calvary, Savior divine!

Thine I am, O spotless Lamb: nothing in the world can hide thee; naught I ask beside thee. 2 In thine arm I rest me; foes who would oppress me cannot reach me here. Though the earth be shaking, every heart be quaking, Jesus calms my fear; lightnings flash and thunders crash: yet, though sin and hell assail me, Jesus will not fail me. 3 Hence, all fears and sadness! For the Lord of gladness, Jesus, enters in: God, who dearly loves us, from all trial saves us; gives sweet peace within; I have borne this worldly scorn; still in thee lies purest pleasure, Jesus, priceless treasure! Informational Notes The classic marriage of words and music that characterizes German chorales can be seen well in this simple but intense text voiced by an already elegant tune that Bach burnishes in his harmonization. Text and tune evoke each other and reinforce the ardor of those who sing.","1 Jesus, priceless treasure, source of purest pleasure, truest friend to me; ah, how long I’ve panted, and my heart has fainted, thirsting, Lord, for thee!

None compares with you, O blessed One; O how great your faithfulness. Spanish: Tu fidelidad es grande, tu fidelidad incomparable es. Nadie como tú, bendito Dios. Grande tu fidelidad. Informational Notes This short song’s derivation from Lamentations 3:23 is somewhat more obvious in the original Spanish text than in the English version, so it is desirable to sing both languages whenever feasible. Like chants from Taizé, this piece benefits from being sung more than once.","I depend upon your faithfulness. I can journey on, for you are always there.

(Refrain) 2 It is not the work of my hands that has washed away all my sins. I’m redeemed, and all of my days, Jesus Christ will be my heart’s praise. 	(Refrain) 3 When my days on this earth are done, and I stand at God’s holy throne, my heart will not have any fear; in Christ’s righteousness I am here. 	(Refrain) Informational Notes This hymn represents a Kenyan adaptation of the gospel hymn, “My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less” (see no. 353), a connection that is most obvious in their similar refrains. Both the original and derived texts affirm that our hope is not in ourselves but in Christ’s redeeming work.","Refrain: Here on Jesus Christ I will stand. He’s the solid rock of my life.

Informational Notes This intense hymn of commitment to God (addressed as Love, Light, and Joy) closes with an invocation of the ultimate testimony to those attributes (the Cross). The composer, a Scotsman, named this specially-composed tune for the 11th-century patroness of Scotland.","1 O Love that wilt not let me go, I rest my weary soul in thee; I give thee back the life I owe, that in thine ocean depths its flow may richer, fuller be. 2 O Light that followest all my way, I yield my flickering torch to thee; my heart restores its borrowed ray, that in thy sunshine’s blaze its day may brighter, fairer be. 3 O Joy that seekest me through pain, I cannot close my heart to thee; I trace the rainbow through the rain, and feel the promise is not vain that morn shall tearless be. 4 O Cross that liftest up my head, I dare not ask to fly from thee; I lay in dust life’s glory dead, and from the ground there blossoms red life that shall endless be."

Through the storm, through the night, lead me on to the light; take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home. 2 When my way grows drear, precious Lord, linger near; when my life is almost gone, hear my cry, hear my call, hold my hand lest I fall; Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home. Informational Notes This black gospel song, like much hymnody, sprang out of the author’s deep personal loss (the death of his wife and newborn son), yet it has brought solace to many. He thought his fingers were playing new music, but they unlocked a deep memory of a tune almost a century old.","1 Precious Lord, take my hand; lead me on, help me stand; I am tired, I am weak, I am worn. Through the storm, through the night, lead me on to the light; take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home. 2 When my way grows drear, precious Lord, linger near; when my life is almost gone, hear my cry, hear my call, hold my hand lest I fall; Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home."

(Refrain) 3 When my feeble life is o’er, time for me will be no more; guide me gently, safely o’er to thy shore, dear Lord, to thy shore.	(Refrain) Informational Notes 835	Just a Closer Walk with Thee

The chromatic musical style of this anonymous short hymn suggests that it probably dates from the early 20th century. It also seems to owe much of its popularity to radio broadcasts and recordings as well as to evangelistic meetings and singing conventions of that era.","Refrain: Just a closer walk with thee, grant it, Jesus, is my plea, daily walking close to thee: let it be, dear Lord, let it be. 1 I am weak, but thou art strong; Jesus, keep me from all wrong; I’ll be satisfied as long as I walk, let me walk close to thee.

When other helpers fail and comforts flee, help of the helpless, O abide with me. 2 Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day; earth's joys grow dim; its glories pass away; change and decay in all around I see. O thou who changest not, abide with me. 3 I need thy presence every passing hour; what but thy grace can foil the tempter's power? Who, like thyself, my guide and stay can be? Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me. 4 I fear no foe, with thee at hand to bless; ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness. Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory? I triumph still, if thou abide with me. 5 Hold thou thy cross before my closing eyes; shine through the gloom and point me to the skies. Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee; in life, in death, O Lord, abide with me. Informational Notes By blending end of day and end of life, the imagery of this well-known Victorian hymn has made it valuable for both evening services and funerals. Although the author wrote his own music for it, the present tune has been firmly associated with this text for over 150 years.","1 Abide with me: fast falls the eventide. The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!

(Refrain) 3 What have I to dread, what have I to fear, leaning on the everlasting arms? I have blessed peace with my Lord so near, leaning on the everlasting arms. 	(Refrain) Informational Notes The composer of the tune (and creator of the refrain) asked the author of the stanzas to write a hymn based on the latter part of Deuteronomy 33:27 (as worded in the King James Version): “Underneath are the everlasting arms.” Their joint effort has proved very popular.","1 What a fellowship, what a joy divine, leaning on the everlasting arms; what a blessedness, what a peace is mine, leaning on the everlasting arms.

(Refrain) 4 Standing on the promises I cannot fall, listening every moment to the Spirit’s call, resting in my Savior as my all in all, standing on the promises of God. 	(Refrain) Informational Notes Perhaps because this hymn is so well known, its language sounds vaguely scriptural; but while there are various biblical uses of “stand” and “promise(s),” the two words are never combined. The confidence here is similar to that of “My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less” (see no. 353).","1 Standing on the promises of Christ my king, through eternal ages let his praises ring; glory in the highest, I will shout and sing, standing on the promises of God.

(Refrain) Informational Notes This text is a remarkable expression of faith born of grief. The author, an active Presbyterian layman who had just lost four daughters in a tragic shipwreck, wrote it while sailing to Paris to meet his wife, who had survived. The tune was named for the ship that sank.","When Peace like a River It Is Well with My Soul 1 When peace like a river attendeth my way, when sorrows like sea billows roll, whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say, it is well, it is well with my soul.

God's might thy heart shall strengthen, God's love thy joy increase; mercy thy days shall lengthen; the Lord will give thee peace. Informational Notes Preserving the author’s intention, his abbreviated paraphrase of Psalm 27 appears here in two eight-line stanzas, the first containing general affirmations and the second assurances to his fainting soul. This sense of resolution is strengthened by the sturdy shape-note tune.","1 God is my strong salvation; what foe have I to fear? In peril and temptation my light, my help, is near.

Refrain Informational Notes This adaptation of Psalm 27:1 from the Taizé Community provides an effective refrain for a responsive reading of the whole psalm. The two melodies can be sung either in harmony or as a round.

It can be used alone for repeated singing or as a prayer response, but it appears here as a refrain that ties together the entire psalm.","My soul is at rest in God alone; my salvation comes from God.

The tune is based on a traditional English ballad air named for a village in North Yorkshire.","1 Incline your ear, O Lord, to me, for I am poor, and need your care, my God, the anchor of my trust, the truest answer to my prayer. 2 You, Lord, have shown to me your grace, in ways beyond my mortal sight.

Informational Notes The opening phrase here (based on 1 Timothy 6:12) is not a military image but an athletic one, from a Greek verb meaning “struggle” or “grapple” or “wrestle.” The sports context continues in later stanzas reflecting the experience of a runner (recalling Hebrews 12:1–2).","1 Fight the good fight with all thy might. Christ is thy strength and Christ thy right. Lay hold on life, and it shall be thy joy and crown eternally. 2 Run the straight race through God's good grace; lift up thine eyes, and seek Christ's face. Life with its way before us lies; Christ is the path, and Christ the prize. 3 Cast care aside; lean on thy guide. God's boundless mercy will provide. Trust, and thy trusting soul shall prove Christ is its life, and Christ its love. 4 Faint not nor fear: God's arms are near. God changeth not, and thou art dear. Only believe, and thou shalt see that Christ is all in all to thee."
847,"Previous Hymn Next Hymn Favorite Create Our Hope, Our Life Added to Favorites Lyrics 1 Our hope, our life are in the Lord, the God we honor and confess. Why crave renown or opulence? They fade, those things we now possess. 2 Some flaunt their gold; some trust its power, but what they cherish will decay; and still the ransom for a soul remains a price too great to pay. 3 Though wealth or learning may be ours, or fame that spreads throughout the land, the shackles of mortality prevent so much that we have planned. 4 Beyond this age of shame and sham we glimpse a better destiny: the Lord will lift us free from death to dwell in praise eternally. Informational Notes As this recent paraphrase of Psalm 49 illustrates, human beings have long been tempted to put their trust in earthly assets, especially wealth and fame. But these are not enduring possessions, and they cannot save us. Only in God can we find unfailing hope and eternal life.","1 Our hope, our life are in the Lord, the God we honor and confess.

Informational Notes Psalm 125 is one of the songs that would have been sung by Jewish pilgrims going to Jerusalem. As the imagery of this paraphrase suggests, it was probably reserved for use during the final ascent to the city, closing with a prayer for peace wherever God’s faithful people dwell.","1 Trust in God and you will be sheltered for eternity; like a mountain, strong and sure, by God’s grace you will endure. 2 Lift your eyes to see the hills, through the ages standing still, wrapped around the city walls: so our God surrounds us all. 3 In the promised, holy land may the wicked never stand; but where good and kindness reign, may the peace of God remain."

This one is based on the singing of the Mooiplaas congregation in South Africa.","Come, bring your burdens to God; come, bring your burdens to God; come, bring your burdens to God, for Jesus will never say no.
