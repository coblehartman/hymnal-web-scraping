3,Womb of Life and Source of Being,"1 Womb of life and source of being, home of every restless heart, in your arms the worlds awakened; you have loved us from the start.

Infinite your vast domain, everlasting is your reign. 2 Hark! The glad celestial hymn angel choirs above are raising; cherubim and seraphim, in unceasing chorus praising, fill the heavens with sweet accord: “Holy, holy, holy Lord!” 3 All apostles join the strain as your sacred name they hallow; prophets swell the glad refrain, and the blessed martyrs follow, and from morn to set of sun, through the church the song goes on. 4 Holy Father, Holy Son, Holy Spirit: three we name you, while in essence only one; undivided God we claim you, and adoring, bend the knee while we own the mystery."

Christ beneath me, Christ above me, Christ in quiet, Christ in danger, Christ in hearts of all that love me, Christ in mouth of friend and stranger. 6 I bind unto myself the name, the strong name of the Trinity by invocation of the same, the Three in One and One in Three, of whom all nature has creation, eternal Father, Spirit, Word. Praise to the Lord of my salvation; salvation is of Christ the Lord!"
7,"Mothering God, You Gave Me Birth","1 Mothering God, you gave me birth in the bright morning of this world. Creator, source of every breath, you are my rain, my wind, my sun. 2 Mothering Christ, you took my form, offering me your food of light, grain of life, and grape of love, your very body for my peace. 3 Mothering Spirit, nurturing one, in arms of patience hold me close, so that in faith I root and grow until I flower, until I know."
8,"Eternal Father, Strong to Save","1 Eternal Father, strong to save, whose arm has bound the restless wave, who bade the mighty ocean deep its own appointed limits keep: O hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea. 2 O Savior, whose almighty word the winds and waves submissive heard, who walked upon the foaming deep, and calm amid its rage did sleep: O hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea. 3 O Holy Spirit, who did brood upon the chaos wild and rude, and bade its angry tumult cease, and gave, for fierce confusion, peace: O hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea. 4 O Trinity of love and power, all travelers guard in danger's hour; from rock and tempest, fire and foe, protect them wheresoe'er they go; thus evermore shall rise to thee glad praise from air and land and sea."
9,The Play of the Godhead,"1 The play of the Godhead, the Trinity’s dance, embraces the earth in a sacred romance: with God the Creator, and Christ the true Son, entwined with the Spirit, a web daily spun in spangles of mystery, the great Three-in-One. 2 The warm mists of summer, cool waters that flow, turn crystal as ice when the wintry winds blow. The taproot that nurtures, the shoot growing free, the life-giving fruit, full and ripe on the tree: more mystic and wondrous, the great One-in-Three. 3 In God’s gracious image of co-equal parts, we gather as dancers, uniting our hearts. Men, women, and children, and all living things, we join in the round of bright nature that rings with rapture and rhythm: creation now sings!"

In all life thou livest, the true life of all. We blossom and flourish like leaves on the tree, then wither and perish; but naught changeth thee. 4 Thou reignest in glory; thou dwellest in light.

13,"The Mighty God, with Power Speaks","1 The Mighty God with power speaks, and all the world obeys; from dawn until the setting sun, God’s wonder earth displays. The perfect beauty all around from Zion's height shines forth; and stars across the firmament so brightly beam their worth. 2 God comes not with a silent form, but riding on the winds; before God’s face, the raging storm its blast of thunder sends. All hail the Judge, in bold array, whose promise is to bless; who sees our sins, yet also feels our thirst for righteousness. 3 The heavens declare your justice, Lord, as endless as the sky; against the taunts of disbelief, our God will testify.

Great Creator, still creating, show us what we yet may do. 2 Proudly rise our modern cities, stately buildings row on row. Yet their windows, blank, unfeeling, stare on canyoned streets below, where the lonely drift unnoticed in the city’s ebb and flow, lost to purpose and to meaning, scarcely caring where they go. 3 We have ventured worlds undreamed of since the childhood of our race; known the ecstasy of winging though untraveled realms of space; probed the secrets of the atom, yielding unimagined power, facing us with life’s destruction or our most triumphant hour. 4 As each far horizon beckons, may it challenge us anew, children of creative purpose, serving others, honoring you. May our dreams prove rich with promise, each endeavor well begun. Great Creator, give us guidance till our goals and yours are one."
25,"O Lord, Our God, How Excellent","1 O Lord, our God, how excellent, how glorious is your name. Your majesty surrounds the earth, and children sing your fame. 2 The heavens shout your handiwork; we stand beneath in awe, to think the One who made all things should care for us at all. 3 Yet you have made us less than gods, surpassing all but you, with heart and mind, with strength and will, to search for what is true. 4 Into our hands you've placed all things: the earth, the sea; each place we're called to probe for secret gifts and venture into space. 5 O Lord, our God, how excellent, how glorious is your name, majestic in your holiness.

27,Sacred the Body,"1 Sacred the body God has created, temple of Spirit that dwells deep inside. Cherish each person; nurture relation. Treat flesh as holy, that love may abide. 2 Bodies are varied, made in all sizes, pale, full of color; both fragile and strong. Holy the difference, gift of the Maker, so let us honor each story and song. 3 Love respects persons, bodies and boundaries. Love does not batter, neglect, or abuse. Love touches gently, never coercing. Love leaves the other with power to choose. 4 Holy of holies, God ever loving, make us your temples; indwell all we do. May we be careful, tender and caring, so may our bodies give honor to you."
28,"You Are Before Me, Lord","1 You are before me, Lord, you are behind, and over me you have spread out your hand; such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too high to grasp, too great to understand. 2 Then from your Spirit where, Lord, shall I go; and from your presence where, Lord, shall I fly? If I ascend to heaven you are there, and still are with me if in hell I lie. 3 If I should take my flight into the dawn, if I should dwell on ocean's farthest shore, your mighty hand will rest upon me still, and your right hand will guard me evermore. 4 If I should say, ""Let darkness cover me, and I shall hide within the veil of night,"" surely the darkness is not dark to you: the night is as the day, the darkness light. 5 Search me, O God; search me and know my heart; try me, O God; my mind and spirit try; keep me from any path that gives you pain, and lead me in the everlasting way."
29,"O God, You Search Me","1 O God, you search me and you know me. All my thoughts lie open to your gaze. When I walk or lie down you are before me: ever the maker and keeper of my days. 2 You know my resting and my rising. You discern my purpose from afar, and with love everlasting you besiege me: in every moment of life or death, you are. 3 Before a word is on my tongue, Lord, you have known its meaning through and through. You are with me beyond my understanding: God of my present, my past, and future, too. 4 Although your Spirit is upon me, still I search for shelter from your light. There is nowhere on earth I can escape you: even the darkness is radiant in your sight. 5 For you created me and shaped me, gave me life within my mother’s womb. For the wonder of who I am, I praise you: safe in your hands, all creation is made new."
30,"O God, in a Mysterious Way","1 O God, in a mysterious way great wonders you perform. You plant your footsteps in the sea and ride upon the storm. 2 Deep in unfathomable mines of never-failing skill, you treasure up your bright designs and work your sovereign will. 3 O fearful saints, fresh courage take. The clouds you so much dread are big with mercy and shall break in blessings on your head. 4 Our unbelief is sure to err and scan your work in vain. You are your own interpreter, and you will make it plain."
31,Let Us with a Gladsome Mind,"1 Let us with a gladsome mind praise the Lord who is so kind: for God's mercies shall endure, ever faithful, ever sure. 2 God, with all-commanding might, filled the new-made world with light: for God's mercies shall endure, ever faithful, ever sure. 3 All things living God does feed; with full measure, meets their need: for God's mercies shall endure, ever faithful, ever sure. 4 Let us with a gladsome mind praise the Lord who is so kind: for God's mercies shall endure, ever faithful, ever sure."
32,I Sing the Mighty Power of God,"1 I sing the mighty power of God that made the mountains rise, that spread the flowing seas abroad and built the lofty skies. I sing the wisdom that ordained the sun to rule the day. The moon shines full at God's command, and all the stars obey. 2 I sing the goodness of the Lord who filled the earth with food. God formed the creatures through the Word, and then pronounced them good. Lord, how thy wonders are displayed, where'er I turn my eye, if I survey the ground I tread, or gaze upon the sky! 3 There's not a plant or flower below but makes thy glories known. And clouds arise, and tempests blow, by order from thy throne, while all that borrows life from thee is ever in thy care, and everywhere that we can be, thou, God, art present there."

Stretching out the heavens like tent cloth, you are chambered on the deep. Riding on the wings of windstorm, flame and fire your bidding keep. 2 Lord, you laid the earth's foundation that it would be always sound. By the word of your commanding, you set forth each ocean's bound. Springs gush forth at your own bidding, giving drink to every field. Bird and beast and all your creatures in that coolness find thirst healed. 3 Grass you cause to grow for cattle, plants for us to cultivate. Food you bring forth from our labor, wine for joy and bread for plate. Trees you give the birds for shelter, mountain rock and cave for beast. Sun and moon both mark the seasons; in their light we work and feast. 4 Lord, how great are all your workings; wisdom marks them through and through. All the earth is your possession; great and small belong to you. Food you give in each due season; at your hand come all good things. By your Spirit you create us; Lord, your breath renewal brings. 5 May your glory reign forever. Lord, rejoice in all you make! As you look on your creation, mountains smoke, foundations shake. May these words and thoughts be pleasing, for in you my joy is found. Bless the Lord, my soul and being! With this song let praise abound."

All ye who hear, now to his temple draw near; join me in glad adoration! 2 Praise ye the Lord, who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth, shelters thee under his wings, yea, so gently sustaineth! Hast thou not seen how thy desires e'er have been granted in what he ordaineth? 3 Praise ye the Lord! O let all that is in me adore him! All that hath life and breath, come now with praises before him! Let the amen sound from his people again; gladly for aye we adore him."
36,For the Fruit of All Creation,"1 For the fruit of all creation, thanks be to God. For the gifts to every nation, thanks be to God. For the plowing, sowing, reaping, silent growth while we are sleeping, future needs in earth's safekeeping, thanks be to God. 2 In the just reward of labor, God's will be done. In the help we give our neighbor, God's will be done. In our worldwide task of caring for the hungry and despairing, in the harvests we are sharing, God's will be done. 3 For the harvests of the Spirit, thanks be to God. For the good we all inherit, thanks be to God. For the wonders that astound us, for the truths that still confound us, most of all that love has found us, thanks be to God."
37,Let All Things Now Living,"1 Let all things now living a song of thanksgiving to God our Creator triumphantly raise; who fashioned and made us, protected and stayed us, by guiding us on to the end of our days. God's banners are o'er us; pure light goes before us, a pillar of fire shining forth in the night: till shadows have vanished, all fearfulness banished, as forward we travel from light into light. 2 By law God enforces, the stars in their courses, the sun in its orbit obediently shine; the hills and the mountains, the rivers and fountains, the depths of the ocean proclaim God divine. We too should be voicing our love and rejoicing; with glad adoration, a song let us raise, till all things now living unite in thanksgiving: to God in the highest, hosanna and praise!"
38,To Bless the Earth,"1 To bless the earth God sends us from heaven's abundant store the waters of the springtime, enriching it once more. 2 The seed by God provided is sown o'er hill and plain, and then come gentle showers to bless the springing grain. 3 God crowns the year with goodness; the earth God's mercy fills; the wilderness is fruitful, and joyful are the hills. 4 With grain the fields are covered; the flocks in pastures graze; all nature joins in singing a joyful song of praise."
39,Great Is Thy Faithfulness,"1 *Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father; there is no shadow of turning with thee. Thou changest not; thy compassions they fail not. As thou hast been thou forever wilt be. Refrain: Great is thy faithfulness! Great is thy faithfulness! Morning by morning, new mercies I see. All I have needed thy hand hath provided. Great is thy faithfulness, Lord unto me! 2 Summer and winter, and springtime and harvest, sun, moon, and stars in their courses above join with all nature in manifold witness to thy great faithfulness, mercy, and love.

(Estribillo) La palabra del Señor es recta y sus obras son maravillosas. La justicia y el derecho tienen tronos a su diestra y de su misericordia llena está toda la tierra; y de su misericordia llena está toda la tierra. Sprung from a word of God’s speaking, skies open, vast beyond measure; borne on the wind of God’s breathing, stars light the heavens in splendor. Gathering the seas in a storehouse, God confines the raging waters, pooling their deeps into wellsprings, carving streams through mountain gorges. Let all the earth and its peoples bow down before God in wonder, trembling to see works of power, building and breaking asunder. Foiling the plans of the wicked, God casts down the might of nations, only the plans of the Holy standing firm through generations."
41,"O Worship the King, All Glorious Above!","1 O worship the King, all glorious above! O gratefully sing God's power and God’s love: our shield and defender, the Ancient of Days, pavilioned in splendor and girded with praise. 2 O tell of God's might; O sing of God's grace, whose robe is the light, whose canopy space, whose chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form; and bright is God's path on the wings of the storm. 3 The earth with its store of wonders untold, Almighty, your power has founded of old; established it fast by a changeless decree, and round it has cast, like a mantle, the sea. 4 Your bountiful care what tongue can recite? It breathes in the air; it shines in the light; it streams from the hills; it descends to the plain, and sweetly distills in the dew and the rain. 5 Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail, in you do we trust, nor find you to fail; your mercies, how tender, how firm to the end, our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend."
42,"Your Faithfulness, O Lord, Is Sure","1 Your faithfulness, O Lord, is sure in all your words, your gracious deeds; you gently lift all burdened souls and well provide for all our needs. 2 The eyes of all are fixed on you; by you their wants are all supplied; your open hand is bountiful and every soul is satisfied. 3 Lord, you are just in all your ways, and kind in everything you do; forever near you stand to hear and help all those who call on you. 4 My mouth shall speak your praise, O Lord; my soul shall bless your holy name; let all things living join the song of praise, from age to age the same."
43,You Who Dwell in the Shelter of the Lord,"1 You who dwell in the shelter of the Lord, who abide in his shadow for life, say to the Lord, “My refuge, my rock in whom I trust!” Refrain: And he will raise you up on eagles’ wings, bear you on the breath of dawn, make you to shine like the sun, and hold you in the palm of his hand. 2 The snare of the fowler will never capture you, and famine will bring you no fear: under his wings, your refuge, his faithfulness your shield. (Refrain) 3 You need not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day; though thousands fall about you, near you it shall not come. (Refrain) 4 For to his angels he’s given a command to guard you in all of your ways; upon their hands they will bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone."
44,Like a Mother Who Has Borne Us,"1 Like a mother who has borne us, held us close in her delight, fed us freely from her body, God has called us into life. 2 Like a father who has taught us, grasped our hand and been our guide, lifted us and healed our sorrows, God has walked with us in life. 3 Though as children we have wandered, placed our trust in power and might, left behind our brothers, sisters, God still calls us into life. 4 When we offer food and comfort, grasp our neighbor’s hand in love, tread the path of peace and justice, God still walks with us in life."
45,I to the Hills Will Lift My Eyes,"1 I to the hills will lift my eyes; from whence shall come my aid? My help is from the Lord alone, who heaven and earth has made. 2 God will not let your foot be moved; your guardian never sleeps; God's watchful and unslumbering care protects and safely keeps. 3 Your faithful keeper is the Lord, your shelter and your shade. 'Neath sun or moon, by day or night, you shall not be afraid. 4 From evil God will keep you safe, provide for all you need. Your going out, your coming in, God will forever lead."
46,Unless the Lord the House Shall Build,"1 Unless the Lord the house shall build, the weary builders toil in vain; unless the Lord the city shield, the guards a useless watch maintain. 2 In vain you rise at morning break, and late your nightly vigils keep, and weary days of toil partake; for God's beloved there is sleep. 3 Like arrows in full quivers stored are children given in days of youth; for children are a great reward, a gift from God in very truth."
47,Bless All Who Trust in God,"1 Bless all who trust in God and walk within God’s ways; bless every soul whose happiness springs from the Lord’s own praise! 2 Let families be strong and sparkle bright as wine; let partners and let children thrive and flourish like the vine! 3 And since we may not boast such joys are ours by right, teach us, good Lord, to take your gifts with thanks and with delight."
48,Rain Down,"Rain down; rain down; rain down your love on your people. Rain down; rain down; rain down your love, God of life."
49,The God of Abraham Praise,"1 The God of Abraham praise, who reigns enthroned above, the Ancient of Eternal Days, the God of love! The Lord, the great I am, by earth and heaven confessed, we bow before your holy name, forever blest. 2 Your spirit still flows free, high surging where it will. In prophet's word you spoke of old and you speak still. Established is your law, and changeless it shall stand, deep writ upon the human heart by your strong hand. 3 Your goodly land we seek, with peace and plenty blest, a land of sacred liberty and Sabbath rest. There milk and honey flow, and oil and wine abound, and trees of life forever grow with mercy crowned. 4 You have eternal life implanted in the soul; your love shall be our strength and stay, while ages roll. We praise you, living God! We praise your holy name: the first, the last, beyond all thought, and still the same!"
50,Deep in the Shadows of the Past,"1 Deep in the shadows of the past, far out from settled lands, some nomads traveled with their God across the desert sands. The dawning hope of humankind by them was sensed and shown: a promise calling them ahead, a future yet unknown. 2 While others bowed to changeless gods, they met a mystery, invisible, without a name: ""I am what I will be""; and by their tents, around their fires in story, song, and law, they praised, remembered, handed on a past that promised more. 3 From Exodus to Pentecost the promise changed and grew, while some, remembering the past, recorded what they knew, or with their letters and laments, their prophecy and praise, recovered, kindled, and expressed new hope for changing days. 4 For all the writings that survived, for leaders, long ago, who sifted, copied, and preserved the Bible that we know, give thanks, and find its story yet our promise, strength, and call, the model of emerging faith, alive with hope for all."
51,To Abraham and Sarah,"1 To Abraham and Sarah the call of God was clear: “Go forth and I will show you a country rich and fair. You need not fear the journey, for I have pledged my word that you shall be my people and I will be your God.” 2 From Abraham and Sarah arose a pilgrim race, dependent for their journey on God’s abundant grace; and in their heart was written by God this saving word, “That you shall be my people and I will be your God.” 3 We of this generation on whom God’s hand is laid can journey to the future secure and unafraid, rejoicing in God’s goodness and trusting in this word, “That you shall be my people and I will be your God.”"
52,When Israel Was in Egypt's Land,"1 When Israel was in Egypt's land, let my people go; oppressed so hard they could not stand, let my people go! Refrain: Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt's land; tell old Pharaoh: let my people go! 2 ""Thus saith the Lord,"" bold Moses said, ""Let my people go! If not, I'll smite your firstborn dead. Let my people go!"" (Refrain) 3 ""No more shall they in bondage toil: let my people go! Let them come out with Egypt's spoil: let my people go!"" (Refrain) 4 O let us all from bondage flee; let my people go! And let us all in Christ be free: let my people go!"
53,"O God, Who Gives Us Life","1 O God, who gives us life and breath, who shapes us in the womb, who guards our lives from birth to death, then leads us from the tomb: deliver us from fears that kill the life we have from you. Help us to know your Spirit still is making all things new. 2 O God, who calls your people out to venture and to dare, to plumb the bleak abyss of doubt and find you even there: when we despair in wandering through wastes of empty lies, refresh us with the living spring of hope that never dies. 3 O God of covenant and law, revealed in cloud and flame, your mighty deeds evoke our awe; we dare not speak your name. Yet we by faith are drawn to you and will your people prove, as on our hearts you write anew the covenant of love."
54,Make a Joyful Noise to God!,"1 Make a joyful noise to God! All creation sings your praise! Great your wonders here displayed, unexcelled throughout our days. Glorious is your sacred name, ages old, yet still the same. 2 Come and see what God has done, great the blessings to the just: walked the chosen through the sea, brought their enemies to dust. Let us lift a thankful voice for God's mercies, and rejoice! 3 Bless the Lord, our refuge sure; let our songs of praise be heard! By whose justice, we are tried; by whose grace, our guilt deferred. When our life's sure end shall come, bring us to your heavenly home."
55,"Come like Driving Wind, O God","1 Come like driving wind, O God, let your enemies be smoke. Come like searing fire, O God, let your enemies be wax. 2 Let your people shout for joy; let them cheer and chant your name, singing of the path you take, riding on the glory clouds. 3 Orphan’s father, widow’s hope, grace from heaven for the earth, you bring home the dispossessed; you set slaves and prisoners free. 4 When you led your people out, marching through the wilderness, earth was shaking as you went, rain was pouring from the sky. 5 Sing to God, all round the earth, God whose freedom has no bound, God who speaks for all to hear, God whose blessing is our life."
56,Sing Out with Joy to God Our Strength,"1 Sing out with joy to God our strength. The God of Jacob praise, who brought us forth from Egypt’s grip: from slavery we were saved. God promised to provide for us, to nurture and to feed, to fill our mouths with all good things, to give us all we need. 2 But we, your people, would not hear, nor listen to your voice. Our selfish wills would not submit, nor make your way our choice. You gave us to our stubborn hearts, their counsel to obey. We turned from all your promises, to walk in our own way. 3 You plead for us to hear your voice, to hearken and obey. You promise to subdue our foes, and sweep them all away. You pledge to give us all we need, with finest wheat supply, and give us honey from the rock, rich food to satisfy."
57,"Tremble, O Tremble","1 Tremble, O tremble! The God whose throne is near to us is ruler of the world. The Holy One! 2 Tremble, O tremble! The justice done by God for us will shake and mend the world. O Holy One! 3 Tremble, O tremble! When Moses, Aaron, Samuel cried out, our God replied. The Holy One! 4 Tremble, O tremble! A tower made of cloud, a voice that spoke a lasting law. The Holy One! 5 Tremble, O tremble! Our God forgives, and yet our sin must be set right at last. O Holy One!"
58,When Israel Was Going Forth,"1 When Israel was going forth from out of Egypt’s land, and Jacob’s house from foreign tongues they could not understand, 2 to be God’s holy dwelling place, God’s choice on Judah fell, and there as God’s dominion took God’s chosen Israel. 3 The sea beheld and fled away; the Jordan stopped its flow. The mountains skipped like rams; the hills like lambs skipped to and fro. 4 O sea, why did you run away? O Jordan, why turn tide? You mounts and hills, like rams and lambs, why leap on every side? 5 O tremble, earth, before the Lord; the God of Jacob fear; God made the rock a water pool, the stone a fountain clear."
59,The Steadfast Love of the Lord,"Refrain: The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; God’s mercies never come to an end. They are new every morning, new every morning; great is your faithfulness, O Lord, great is your faithfulness. Give thanks to the Lord and call upon God’s name; make know the deeds of the Lord among the peoples. Sing to the Lord, sing praises, and speak of all God’s marvelous works. Glory in God’s holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice. Search for the Lord and the strength of the Lord; continually seek the face of God. Remember the marvels God has done, the wonders and the judgments of God’s mouth, O offspring of Abraham, God’s servant, O children of Jacob, God’s chosen. (Refrain) The Lord is our God, whose judgments prevail in all the world. The Lord has always been mindful of the covenant, the promise made for a thousand generations: The covenant made with Abraham, the oath sworn to Isaac, which God established as a statute for Jacob, and everlasting covenant for Israel. For God remembered the holy promise and Abraham, chosen to serve. So God led forth the people with gladness, the chosen ones with shouts of joy. (Refrain)"
60,"Your Endless Love, Your Mighty Acts","1 Your endless love, your mighty acts surpass what words can tell; Lord, may the joys your people know be mine to share as well. 2 Our rebel forebears rarely grasped your mercy or your might; we need your mercy, just like them: we, too, do wrong not right. 3 Before a golden calf they bowed— an idol in your place!— until, by Moses’ faithful prayer, you drew them back to grace. 4 But when they spurned the promised land, you made your anger plain: they wandered long on desert paths, and served the Baals again. 5 Yet those whom once you sold in wrath, in mercy you restored; may we, like them, be gathered in to thank and praise you, Lord."
61,"Your Law, O Lord, Is Perfect","1 Your law, O Lord, is perfect, the simple making wise; how pure are your commandments, enlightening my eyes! 2 More to be sought than riches, your words are my soul’s wealth; their taste is sweet like honey, imparting life and health. 3 My strength and my redeemer, lawgiver and true light, my words and meditations make worthy in your sight."
62,Love the Lord Your God,Love the Lord your God with all your heart. Love the Lord your God with all your soul. Love the Lord your God with all your mind. Love the Lord your God with all that you are.
63,The Lord Is God,"1 The Lord is God, the Lord alone! Give honor, thanks, and praise to God, the maker of all things and giver of our days. 2 With all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind and might, O people, love the Lord your God, the source of truth and light. 3 At night or day, at home, away, together and apart, O children, take these holy words and keep them in your heart. 4 The Lord is God, the Lord alone! Give honor, thanks, and praise to God, the maker of all things and giver of our days."
64,I Long for Your Commandments,"1 I long for your commandments; your judgments all are just. Within your words is wisdom, your teachings understood are comfort to my spirit’s need and in the night my solace. Your statutes are my song. 2 Without your lamp to guide me I wander from the way. Without your laws and precepts I stumble in the dark. Your understandings are my hope that I may run in freedom. Your ways are my release. 3 O God, I love your knowledge, more precious than pure gold. It satisfies like honey, a sweetness on my tongue. It leads me to salvation’s door where you have spread your table. O, lead me to your home."
65,"Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah","1 Guide me, O thou great Jehovah, pilgrim through this barren land. I am weak, but thou art mighty. Hold me with thy powerful hand. Bread of heaven, bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more; feed me till I want no more. 2 Open now the crystal fountain, whence the healing stream doth flow. Let the fire and cloudy pillar lead me all my journey through. Strong deliverer, strong deliverer, be thou still my strength and shield; be thou still my strength and shield. 3 When I tread the verge of Jordan, bid my anxious fears subside. Death of death, and hell's destruction, land me safe on Canaan's side. Songs of praises, songs of praises I will ever give to thee; I will ever give to thee."
66,Every Time I Feel the Spirit,"Refrain: Every time I feel the Spirit moving in my heart I will pray. Yes, every time I feel the Spirit moving in my heart I will pray. 1 Upon the mountain, when my Lord spoke, out of God's mouth came fire and smoke. Looked all around me, it looked so fine, till I asked my Lord if all was mine. (Refrain) 2 Jordan River, chilly and cold, it chills the body but not the soul. There is but one train upon this track. It runs to heaven and then right back. (Refrain)"
67,My Song Forever Shall Record,"1 My song forever shall record the tender mercies of the Lord; your faithful love will I proclaim, and every age shall know your name. 2 I sing of mercies that endure, forever firm, forever sure, a strong support that never dies, established changeless in the skies. 3 Almighty God, your lofty throne has justice for its cornerstone, and shining bright before your face are truth and love and boundless grace. 4 With blessing is the nation crowned whose people know the joyful sound; they in the light, O Lord, shall live, the light your face and favor give."
68,Heaven Opened to Isaiah,"1 Heaven opened to Isaiah, showing him God’s glorious throne: Lord of might, high and exalted, temple flowing with his robe. Seraphim flew all around him, humbled at the holy sight. As they circled they were singing, calling out with all their might. Refrain: “Holy, holy, you are holy,” every angel voice proclaims; “All the earth reflects your glory; every tongue sings out your praise!” 2 Seraphim continue singing; cherubim still lift their praise. Earth and all its creatures worship; moon and stars are still amazed. Now above creation’s chorus comes another fervent cry: all of earth’s redeemed are singing, “Glory to the Lord on high!” 3 One day heaven will be opened and before the Savior’s throne, saints from every time and nation will begin their endless song: “To our God of all salvation, to the high and holy Lamb, to the blessed Holy Spirit be forever praise. Amen!”"
69,"I, the Lord of Sea and Sky","1 I, the Lord of sea and sky, I have heard my people cry. All who dwell in dark and sin my hand will save. I, who made the stars of night, I will make their darkness bright. Who will bear my light to them? Whom shall I send? Refrain: Here I am, Lord. Is it I, Lord? I have heard you calling in the night. I will go, Lord, if you lead me. I will hold your people in my heart. 2 I, the Lord of snow and rain, I have borne my people's pain. I have wept for love of them. They turn away. I will break their hearts of stone, give them hearts for love alone. I will speak my word to them. Whom shall I send? (Refrain) 3 I, the Lord of wind and flame, I will tend the poor and lame. I will set a feast for them. My hand will save. Finest bread I will provide till their hearts be satisfied. I will give my life to them. Whom shall I send? (Refrain)"
70,What Does the Lord Require of You?,"What does the Lord require of you? What does the Lord require of you? Justice, kindness, walk humbly with your God. To seek justice and love kindness and walk humbly with your God."

For the Lord is my stronghold and my sure defense, and God will be my Savior. 1 Therefore you shall draw water with rejoicing from the springs of salvation and on that day you shall say, “Give thanks to the Lord and call upon God’s name.” (Refrain) 2 Make God’s deeds known among the peoples; see that they remember that the Lord is exalted. Sing the praises of the Lord, for God has done great things and this is known in all the world. (Refrain) 3 Cry aloud, inhabitants of Zion; ring out your joy, for the great one in the midst of you is the Holy One of Israel. (Refrain)"
72,By the Babylonian Rivers,"1 By the Babylonian rivers we sat down in grief and wept, hung our harps upon the willow, mourned for Zion when we slept. 2 There our captors in derision did require of us a song; so we sat with staring vision, and the days were hard and long. 3 How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange and bitter land; can our voices veil the sorrow? Lord God, hold your holy band."
73,When God Delivered Israel,"1 When God delivered Israel from bondage long ago, they thought that they were dreaming, but soon they turned to laughing and sang the song of joy, and sang the song of joy. 2 The godless nations round them could not deny that power; they cried, ""O see this marvel!"" ""God's work,"" replied the people, and so they sang for joy, and so they sang for joy. 3 O God, restore our nation; come, irrigate dry souls, that those who sow in sadness may reap their sheaves with gladness and sing the song of joy, and sing the song of joy."
74,When God Restored Our Common Life,"1 When God restored our common life, our hope, our liberty, at first it seemed a passing dream, a waking fantasy; a shock of joy swept over us, for we had wept so long; the seeds we watered once with tears sprang up into a song. 2 We went forth weeping, sowing seeds in hard, unyielding soil; with laughing hearts we carry home the fruit of all our toil. We praise the One who gave the growth, with voices full and strong. The seeds we watered once with tears sprang up into a song. 3 Great liberating God, we pray for all who are oppressed. May those who long for what is right with justice now be blest. We pray for those who mourn this day, and all who suffer wrong; may seeds they water now with tears spring up into a song."
75,We Give Thanks unto You,"1 We give thanks unto you, O God of might, for your love is never ending; we give thanks unto you, the God of gods, for your love is never ending. 2 In your wisdom and love you shaped the skies, for your love is never ending; you spread out the earth upon the sea, for your love is never ending. 3 You have filled all the skies with glory and light, for your love is never ending; the sun for the day and the moon for night, for your love is never ending. 4 From of old you have led your people in faith, for your love is never ending; you have shown your compassion, strength, and love, for your love is never ending. 5 You delivered the ones who called unto you, for your love is never ending; from bondage to freedom, you brought them forth, for your love is never ending. 6 You have opened the sea and brought your people through, for your love is never ending; brought them into a land that flows with life, for your love is never ending. 7 You remember your promise age to age, for your love is never ending; you show mercy on those of low degree, for your love is never ending. 8 You give food and life to all living things, for your love is never ending; we give thanks unto you, the God of all, for your love is never ending."
76,Do Not Be Afraid,"Refrain: Do not be afraid, for I am with you. Chosen and beloved, you are my own. Do not be afraid, for I have redeemed you: by your name I called you for my own. 1 Look up, a new thing I am doing; it springs forth; look and see it grow. Through wilderness I’ll make a level highway; through deserts, make streams and rivers flow. (Refrain) 2 I am God, who blots out your transgressions; for my own sake I do not chide or blame. Only this much I ask, that you love me and seek me and honor my name. (Refrain) 3 The Lord, the Holy One of Israel has promised to lead us on our way, and we who love and worship God our Maker will listen to hear the Spirit say: (Refrain)"
77,Isaiah the Prophet Has Written of Old,"1 Isaiah the prophet has written of old how God’s new creation shall come. Instead of the thorn tree, the fir tree shall grow; the wolf shall lie down with the lamb. The mountains and hills shall burst forth into song, the peoples be led forth in peace, for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of God as the waters cover the sea. 2 Yet nations still prey on the meek of the world, and conflict turns parent from child. Your people despoil all the sweetness of earth; the briar and the thorn tree grow wild. God, bring to fruition your will for the earth, that no one shall hurt or destroy, that wisdom and justice shall reign in the land and your people shall go forth in joy."
78,"You Thirsty Ones, Come","1 You thirsty ones, come to the spring! Have you no money? Come, buy wine and milk; come, buy and eat without a price or sum, without a price or sum. 2 Why do you work and earn and spend on that which is not bread? O listen now and come to me; eat what is good instead; eat what is good instead. 3 This food delights and satisfies, the food your God can give; incline your ear and come to me; O hear that you may live; O hear that you may live. 4 Return while God may still be found, and call while God will hear; now let the wicked quit their ways while yet the Lord is near, while yet the Lord is near. 5 My word like heaven’s snow descends; it falls like heaven’s rain; it waters all the thirsty earth and shall not go in vain, and shall not go in vain."
79,Light Dawns on a Weary World,"1 Light dawns on a weary world when eyes begin to see all people’s dignity. Light dawns on a weary world: the promised day of justice comes. Refrain: The trees shall clap their hands; the dry lands, gush with springs; the hills and mountains shall break forth with singing! We shall go out in joy, and be led forth in peace, as all the world in wonder echoes shalom. 2 Love grows in a weary world when hungry hearts find bread and children’s dreams are fed. Love grows in a weary world: the promised feast of plenty comes. 3 Hope blooms in a weary world when creatures, once forlorn, find wilderness reborn. Hope blooms in a weary world: the promised green of Eden comes."
80,You Shall Go Out with Joy,"You shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace; the mountains and the hills will break forth before you; there’ll be shouts of joy, and all the trees of the field will clap, will clap their hands. And all the trees of the field will clap their hands; the trees of the field will clap their hands; the trees of the field will clap their hands while you go out with joy."
81,Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken,"1 Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God. God, whose word cannot be broken, formed thee for a blest abode. On the rock of ages founded, what can shake thy sure repose? With salvation's walls surrounded, thou may'st smile at all thy foes. 2 Round each habitation hovering, see the cloud and fire appear for a glory and a covering, showing that the Lord in near. Thus deriving from their banner light by night and shade by day, safe they feed upon the manna which God gives them when they pray. 3 See, the streams of living waters, springing from eternal love, well supply thy sons and daughters and all fear of want remove. Who can faint while such a river ever flows, their thirst to_assuage? Grace, so like the Lord the giver, never fails from age to age."

84,Creator of the Stars of Night,"1 Creator of the stars of night, your people’s everlasting light, O Christ, redeemer of us all, we pray you, hear us when we call. 2 When this old world drew on toward night, you came; but not in splendor bright, not as a monarch, but the child of Mary, blameless mother mild. 3 At your great name, O Jesus, now all knees must bend, all hearts must bow: all things on earth with one accord, like those in heaven, shall call you Lord. 4 To God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit, Three in One, praise, honor, might, and glory be from age to age eternally.

(Refrain) 3 The yoke of despair and bondage, the chains of the slave master’s rod are shattered and scattered like dust in a windstorm, loosed by the justice of God.

How far truth and mercy extend. The zeal of the Lord will accomplish its purpose: justice shall reign without end.	(Refrain)"
87,"Comfort, Comfort Now My People","1 “Comfort, comfort now my people; tell of peace!” So says our God. “Comfort those who sit in darkness mourning under sorrow’s load. To my people now proclaim that my pardon waits for them! Tell them that their sins I cover, and their warfare now is over.” 2 For the herald’s voice is crying in the desert far and near, calling us to true repentance, since the reign of God is here. O, that warning cry obey! Now prepare for God a way. Let the valleys rise in meeting and the hills bow down in greeting. 3 Straight shall be what long was crooked, and the rougher places plain. Let your hearts be true and humble, as befits God’s holy reign. For the glory of the Lord now on earth is shed abroad, and all flesh shall see the token that God’s word is never broken."

90,Wait for the Lord,"Refrain: Wait for the Lord, whose day is near. Wait for the Lord; be strong; take heart! Psalm 27 (Refrain) The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom then shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid? When evildoers came upon me to eat up my flesh, it was they, my foes and my adversaries, who stumbled and fell. Though an army should encamp against me, yet my heart shall not be afraid; and though war should rise up against me, yet will I put my trust in the  Lord. One thing have I asked of the Lord; one thing I seek; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life; to behold the fair beauty of the Lord, to seek God in the temple.	(Refrain) For on the day of trouble the Lord shall shelter me in safety; the Lord shall hide me in the secrecy of the holy place and set me high upon a rock. Even now the Lord lifts up my head above my enemies round about me. Therefore I will offer in the holy place an oblation with sounds of great gladness; I will sing and make music to the Lord.	(Refrain) Hearken to my voice, O Lord, when I call; have mercy on me and answer me. You speak in my heart and say, “Seek my face.” Your face, Lord, will I seek. Hide not your face from me, nor turn away your servant in displeasure. You have been my helper; cast me not away; do not forsake me, O God of my salvation. Though my father and my mother forsake me, the Lord will sustain me.	(Refrain) Show me your way, O Lord; lead me on a level path, because of my enemies. Deliver me not into the hand of my adversaries, for false witnesses have risen up against me, and also those who speak malice. What if I had not believed that I should see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living! O tarry and await the Lord’s pleasure; be strong, and the Lord shall comfort your heart; wait patiently for the Lord.	(Refrain)"

I open wide my heart to thee; here, Lord, abide. Let me thy inner presence feel; thy grace and love in me reveal."
94,Now the Heavens Start to Whisper,"1 Now the heavens start to whisper, as the veil is growing thin. Earth from slumber wakes to listen to the stirring, faint within: seed of promise, deeply planted, child to spring from Jesse’s stem! Like the soil beneath the frostline, hearts grow soft to welcome him. 2 Heavy clouds that block the moonlight now begin to drift away. Diamond brilliance through the darkness shines the hope of coming day. Christ, the morning star of splendor, gleams within a world grown dim. Heaven’s ember fans to fullness; hearts grow warm to welcome him. 3 Christ, eternal Sun of justice, Christ, the rose of wisdom’s seed, come to bless with fire and fragrance hours of yearning, hurt, and need. In the lonely, in the stranger, in the outcast, hid from view: child who comes to grace the manger, teach our hearts to welcome you."
95,Prepare the Way of the Lord,"Prepare the way of the Lord. Prepare the way of the Lord, and all people will see the salvation of our God."
96,On Jordan's Bank the Baptist's Cry,"1 On Jordan’s bank the Baptist’s cry announces that the Lord is nigh; awake and hearken, for he brings glad tidings of the King of kings! 2 Then cleansed be every life from sin; make straight the way for God within, and let us all our hearts prepare for Christ to come and enter there. 3 We hail you as our Savior, Lord, our refuge and our great reward; without your grace we waste away like flowers that wither and decay. 4 Stretch forth your hand; our health restore, and make us rise to fall no more. O let your face upon us shine and fill the world with love divine."
97,"Watchman, Tell Us of the Night","1 Watchman, tell us of the night, what its signs of promise are. Traveler, what a wondrous sight: see that glory-beaming star. Watchman, does its beauteous ray news of joy or hope foretell? Traveler, yes; it brings the day, promised day of Israel. 2 Watchman, tell us of the night; higher yet that star ascends. Traveler, blessedness and light, peace and truth its course portends. Watchman, will its beams alone gild the spot that gave them birth? Traveler, ages are its own; see, it bursts o’er all the earth. 3 Watchman, tell us of the night, for the morning seems to dawn. Traveler, shadows take their flight; doubt and terror are withdrawn. Watchman, you may go your way; hasten to your quiet home. Traveler, we rejoice today, for Emmanuel has come!"
98,To a Maid Whose Name Was Mary,"1 To a maid whose name was Mary, the angel Gabriel came. “Fear not,” the angel told her, “I come to bring good news; good news I come to tell you, good news, I say, good news.” 2 “For you are highly favored by God the Lord of all, who even now is with you. You are on earth most blest; you are most blest, most blessed; God chose you, you are blest!” 3 But Mary was most troubled to hear the angel’s word. What was the angel saying? It troubled her to hear, to hear the angel’s message, it troubled her to hear. 4 “Fear not, for God is with you, and you shall bear a child. His name shall be called Jesus, God’s offspring from on high. And he shall reign forever, forever reign on high.” 5 “How shall this be?” said Mary, “I am not yet a wife.” The angel answered quickly, “The power of the Most High will come upon you shortly, your child shall be God’s child.” 6 As Mary heard the angel, she wondered at his words. “Behold, I am your handmaid,” she said unto her God. “So be it; I am ready according to your word.”"
99,My Soul Gives Glory to My God,"1 My soul gives glory to my God; my heart pours out its praise. God lifted up my lowliness in many marvelous ways. 2 My God has done great things for me: yes, holy is God’s name. All people will declare me blessed, and blessings they shall claim. 3 From age to age to all who fear, such mercy love imparts, dispensing justice far and near, dismissing selfish hearts. 4 Love casts the mighty from their thrones, promotes the insecure, leaves hungry spirits satisfied; the rich seem suddenly poor. 5 Praise God, whose loving covenant supports those in distress, remembering past promises with present faithfulness."
100,My Soul Cries Out with a Joyful Shout,"1 My soul cries out with a joyful shout that the God of my heart is great, and my spirit sings of the wondrous things that you bring to the ones who wait. You fixed your sight on your servant’s plight, and my weakness you did not spurn, so from east to west shall my name be blest. Could the world be about to turn? Refrain: My heart shall sing of the day you bring. Let the fires of your justice burn. Wipe away all tears, for the dawn draws near, and the world is about to turn. 2 Though I am small, my God, my all, you work great things in me, and your mercy will last from the depths of the past to the end of the age to be. Your very name puts the proud to shame, and to those who would for you yearn, you will show your might, put the strong to flight, for the world is about to turn.	(Refrain) 3 From the halls of power to the fortress tower, not a stone will be left on stone. Let the king beware for your justice tears every tyrant from his throne. The hungry poor shall weep no more, for the food they can never earn; there are tables spread; every mouth be fed, for the world is about to turn. 	(Refrain) 4 Though the nations rage from age to age, we remember who holds us fast: God’s mercy must deliver us from the conqueror’s crushing grasp. This saving word that our forebears heard is the promise which holds us bound, till the spear and rod can be crushed by God, who is turning the world around. 	(Refrain)"
101,No Wind at the Window,"1 No wind at the window, no knock on the door; no light from the lampstand, no foot on the floor; no dream born of tiredness, no ghost raised by fear: just an angel and a woman and a voice in her ear. 2 ""O Mary, O Mary, don’t hide from my face. Be glad that you’re favored and filled with God’s grace. The time for redeeming the world has begun, and you are requested to mother God’s Son."" 3 ""This child must be born that the kingdom might come: salvation for many, destruction for some; both end and beginning, both message and sign; both victor and victim, both yours and divine."" 4 No payment was promised, no promises made; no wedding was dated, no blueprint displayed. Yet Mary, consenting to what none could guess, replied with conviction, ""Tell God I say, Yes."""
102,"Savior of the Nations, Come","1 Savior of the nations, come; virgin’s son, make here your home. Marvel now, O heaven and earth, that the Lord chose such a birth. 2 From God’s heart the Savior speeds; back to God his pathway leads; out to vanquish death’s command, back to reign at God’s right hand. 3 Now your manger, shining bright, hallows night with newborn light.

O kindle, Lord most holy, a lamp within my breast, to do in spirit lowly all that may please you best. 2 Love caused your incarnation; love brought you down to me; your thirst for my salvation procured my liberty. O love beyond all telling, that led you to embrace in love, all loves excelling, our lost and fallen race. 3 You come, O Lord, with gladness, in mercy and goodwill, to bring an end to sadness and bid our fears be still. In patient expectation we live for that great day when your renewed creation your glory shall display."

People, look east and sing today: Love, the Guest, is on the way. 2 Furrows, be glad. Though earth is bare, one more seed is planted there. Give up your strength the seed to nourish, that in course the flower may flourish. People, look east and sing today: Love, the Rose, is on the way. 3 Birds, though you long have ceased to build, guard the nest that must be filled. Even the hour when wings are frozen God for fledging time has chosen. People, look east and sing today: Love, the Bird, is on the way. 4 Stars, keep the watch. When night is dim one more light the bowl shall brim, shining beyond the frosty weather, bright as sun and moon together. People, look east and sing today: Love, the Star, is on the way. 5 Angels, announce with shouts of mirth Christ who brings new life to earth. Set every peak and valley humming with the word, the Lord is coming. People, look east and sing today: Love, the Lord, is on the way."
106,"Prepare the Way, O Zion","1 Prepare the way, O Zion, your Christ is drawing near! Let every hill and valley a level way appear. Greet One who comes in glory, foretold in sacred story.

Come as a baby weak and poor, to bring all hearts together, he opens wide the heavenly door and lives now inside us forever. 2 To us, to all in sorrow and fear, Emmanuel comes a-singing; his humble song is quiet and near, yet fills the earth with its ringing; music to heal the broken soul and hymns of loving-kindness. The thunder of his anthems rolls to shatter all hatred and violence. 3 In darkest night his coming shall be, when all the world is despairing, as morning light so quiet and free, so warm and gentle and caring. Then shall the mute break forth in song, the lame shall leap in wonder, the weak be raised above the strong, and weapons be broken asunder. 4 Rejoice, rejoice, take heart in the night. Though dark the winter and cheerless, the rising sun shall crown you with light; be strong and loving and fearless. Love be our song and love our prayer and love our endless story; may God fill every day we share and bring us at last into glory."
108,Of the Father's Love Begotten,"1 Of the Father's love begotten, ere the worlds began to be, he is Alpha and Omega; he the source, the ending he, of the things that are, that have been, and that future years shall see, evermore and evermore! 2 By his Word was all created; he commanded; it was done: heaven and earth and depths of ocean, universe of three in one, all that sees the moon’s soft shining, all that breathes beneath the sun, evermore and evermore! 3 O, that birth forever blessed when the Virgin, full of grace, by the Holy Ghost conceiving, bore the Savior of our race, and the babe, the world’s Redeemer, first revealed his sacred face, evermore and evermore! 4 This is he whom seers in old time chanted of with one accord, whom the voices of the prophets promised in their faithful word. Now he shines, the long-expected. Let creation praise its Lord, evermore and evermore! 5 O ye heights of heaven, adore him. Angel hosts, his praises sing. Powers, dominions, bow before him, and extol our God and King. Let no tongue on earth be silent; every voice in concert ring, evermore and evermore! 6 Christ, to thee with God the Father, and, O Holy Ghost, to thee, hymn and chant and high thanksgiving and unwearied praises be. Honor, glory, and dominion, and eternal victory, evermore and evermore! Amen."
109,Blest Be the God of Israel,"lest Be the God of Israel 1 Blest be the God of Israel, who comes to set us free; who visits and redeems us, who grants us liberty. The prophets spoke of mercy, of freedom and release; God shall fulfill that promise and bring the people peace. 2 God from the house of David a child of grace has given; a Savior comes among us to raise us up to heaven. Before him goes the herald, forerunner in the way, the prophet of salvation, the harbinger of day. 3 On those who sit in darkness the sun begins to rise, the dawning of forgiveness upon the sinner’s eyes. God guides the feet of pilgrims along the paths of peace. O bless our God and Savior with songs that never cease!"
110,Love Has Come,"1 Love has come: a light in the darkness! Love shines forth in the Bethlehem skies. See, all heaven has come to proclaim it; hear how their song of joy arises: Love! Love! Born unto you, a Savior! Love! Love! Glory to God on high. 2 Love is born! Come, share in the wonder. Love is God now asleep in the hay.

Love is life everlasting and free. Love is Jesus within and among us. Love is the peace our hearts are seeking. Love! Love! Love is the gift of Christmas. Love! Love! Praise to you, God on high!"

112,On Christmas Night All Christians Sing,"1 On Christmas night all Christians sing, to hear the news the angels bring; on Christmas night all Christians sing, to hear the news the angels bring, news of great joy, news of great mirth, news of our merciful King’s birth. 2 Then why should we on earth be sad, since our Redeemer made us glad; then why should we on earth be sad, since our Redeemer made us glad, when from our sin he set us free, all for to gain our liberty? 3 When sin departs before his grace, then life and health come in its place; when sin departs before his grace, then life and health comes in its place; heaven and earth with joy may sing, all for to see the newborn King. 4 All out of darkness we have light, which made the angels sing this night; all out of darkness we have light, which made the angels sing this night: ""Glory to God in highest heaven; peace on earth and goodwill. Amen!"""
113,Angels We Have Heard on High,"1 Angels we have heard on high, sweetly singing o’er the plains, and the mountains in reply echoing their joyous strains. Gloria in excelsis Deo!

114,Away in a Manger,"1 Away in a manger, no crib for his bed, the little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head. The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay, the little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay. 2 The cattle are lowing; the poor baby wakes, but little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes. I love thee, Lord Jesus; look down from the sky, and stay by my side until morning is nigh. 3 Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask thee to stay close by me forever and love me, I pray. Bless all the dear children in thy tender care, and fit us for heaven to live with thee there."

Venite adoremus Dominum. Venite adoremus Dominum. 2 ‘Twas gentle Mary maid, so young and strong, who welcomed here the Christ-child with a song. She laid him in a stall at Bethlehem; the ass and oxen shared the roof with them. Venite adoremus Dominum. Venite adoremus Dominum. 3 Saint Joseph too was by to tend the child, to guard him, and protect his mother mild. The angels hovered round and sang this song: Venite adoremus Dominum. Venite adoremus Dominum. Venite adoremus Dominum. 4 And thus that manger poor became a throne; for he whom Mary bore was God the Son. O come, then, let us join the heavenly host to praise the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Venite adoremus Dominum. Venite adoremus Dominum."
117,While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks,"1 While shepherds watched their flocks by night, all seated on the ground, the angel of the Lord came down, and glory shone around. 2 “Fear not,” said he, for mighty dread had seized their troubled mind: “Glad tidings of great joy I bring to you and humankind. 3 “To you, in David’s town this day, is born of David’s line the Savior, who is Christ the Lord, and this shall be the sign: 4 “The heavenly babe you there shall find to human view displayed, all humbly wrapped in swathing bands, and in a manger laid.” 5 Thus spoke the seraph, and forthwith appeared a shining throng of angels praising God, who thus addressed their joyful song: 6 “All glory be to God on high, and to the earth be peace; good will to all from highest heaven begin and never cease!”"

Mild he lays his glory by, born that we no more may die, born to raise us from the earth, born to give us second birth. Hark! The herald angels sing, “Glory to the newborn king!”"
120,Where Shepherds Lately Knelt,"1 Where shepherds lately knelt and kept the angel's word, I come in half-belief, a pilgrim strangely stirred. But there is room and welcome there for me; but there is room and welcome there for me. 2 In that unlikely place I find him as they said: sweet, newborn Babe, how frail, and in a manger bed: a still, small voice to cry one day for me; a still, small voice to cry one day for me. 3 How should I not have known Isaiah would be there, his prophecies fulfilled? With pounding heart, I stare: a child, a son, the Prince of Peace for me; a child, a son, the Prince of Peace for me. 4 Can I, will I forget how Love was born and burned its way into my heart: unasked, unforced, unearned: to die, to live, and not alone for me; to die, to live, and not alone for me."
121,O Little Town of Bethlehem,"1 O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie! Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by. Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light; the hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight. 2 For Christ is born of Mary and, gathered all above, while mortals sleep, the angels keep their watch of wondering love. O morning stars, together proclaim the holy birth, and praises sing to God the king, and peace to all on earth. 3 How silently, how silently, the wondrous gift is given! So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of his heaven. No ear may hear his coming, but in this world of sin, where meek souls will receive him, still the dear Christ enters in. 4 O holy child of Bethlehem, descend to us, we pray; cast out our sin and enter in; be born in us today. We hear the Christmas angels the great glad tidings tell; O come to us; abide with us, our Lord Emmanuel!"

123,It Came Upon the Midnight Clear,"1 It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old, from angels bending near the earth, to touch their harps of gold: “Peace on the earth, good will to all, from heaven’s all-gracious King”: the world in solemn stillness lay, to hear the angels sing. 2 Still through the cloven skies they come, with peaceful wings unfurled, and still their heavenly music floats o’er all the weary world: above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing, and ever o’er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing. 3 Yet with the woes of sin and strife the world has suffered long; beneath the heavenly hymn have rolled two thousand years of wrong; and we at war on earth hear not the tidings that they bring; O, hush the noise and cease the strife to hear the angels sing! 4 And you, beneath life’s crushing load, whose forms are bending low, who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow, look now, for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing: O, rest beside the weary road, and hear the angels sing. 5 For lo, the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old, when with the ever-circling years shall come the time foretold, when peace shall over all the earth its ancient splendors fling, and the whole world give back the song which now the angels sing."
124,"Still, Still, Still","1 Still, still, still, he sleeps this night so chill! The virgin’s tender arms enfolding, warm and safe the child are holding. Still, still, still, he sleeps this night so chill. 2 Sleep, sleep, sleep, he lies in slumber deep while angel hosts from heaven come winging, sweetest songs of joy are singing. Sleep, sleep, sleep, he lies in slumber deep."
125,Before the Marvel of This Night,"1 Before the marvel of this night, adoring, fold your wings and bow; then tear the sky apart with light and with your news the world endow. Proclaim the birth of Christ and peace, that fear and death and sorrow cease: sing peace; sing peace; sing gift of peace; sing peace; sing gift of peace! 2 Awake the sleeping world with song: this is the day the Lord has made. Assemble here, celestial throng, in royal splendor come arrayed. Give earth a glimpse of heavenly bliss, a teasing taste of what they miss: sing bliss; sing bliss; sing endless bliss; sing bliss; sing endless bliss! 3 The love that we have always known, our constant joy and endless light, now to the loveless world be shown, now break upon its deathly night. Into one song compress the love that rules our universe above: sing love; sing love; sing God is love; sing love; sing God is love!"
126,"Jesus, Jesus, O What a Wonderful Child","Jesus, Jesus, O what a wonderful child. Jesus, Jesus, so holy, meek and mild; new life, new hope the child will bring. Listen to the angels sing: “Glory, glory, glory!” Let the heavens ring."

128,"Infant Holy, Infant Lowly","1 Infant holy, infant lowly, for his bed a cattle stall; oxen lowing, little knowing Christ the babe is Lord of all. Swift are winging angels singing, noels ringing, tidings bringing: Christ the babe is Lord of all! Christ the babe is Lord of all! 2 Flocks were sleeping; shepherds keeping vigil till the morning new saw the glory, heard the story, tidings of the gospel true. Thus rejoicing, free from sorrow, praises voicing greet the morrow: Christ the babe was born for you! Christ the babe was born for you!"
129,"Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming","1 Lo, how a rose e’er blooming from tender stem hath sprung, of Jesse’s lineage coming, by faithful prophets sung. It came, a floweret bright, amid the cold of winter, when half spent was the night. 2 Isaiah ‘twas foretold it, the rose I have in mind; with Mary we behold it, the virgin mother kind. To show God’s love aright she bore for us a Savior, when half spent was the night. 3 This flower, whose fragrance tender with sweetness fills the air, dispels with glorious splendor the darkness everywhere. Enfleshed, yet very God, from sin and death he saves us and lightens every load."
130,"Break Forth, O Beauteous Heavenly Light","Break forth, O beauteous heavenly light, and usher in the morning. You shepherds, shudder not with fright, but hear the angel’s warning. This child, now weak in infancy, our confidence and joy shall be, the power of Satan breaking, our peace eternal making."
131,In the Heavens Shone a Star,"1 In the heavens shone a star, vanquishing the gloom of night, heralding a wondrous birth; God’s own Son now comes to earth. Refrain: Jesus Christ is born today, Christmas Day! 2 From the angels shepherds heard the good tidings of his birth, and to Bethlehem they sped to behold his manger bed.	(Refrain) 3 Wise men saw the heavenly sign, journeyed far from Orient land, him their Lord and King to greet, offering treasures at his feet. 	(Refrain) 4 Filled with wonder and with awe, at his cradle low we bow to adore the holy child, Son of God, and yet so mild. 	(Refrain)"
132,"Good Christian Friends, Rejoice","1 Good Christian friends, rejoice with heart and soul and voice; give ye heed to what we say: Jesus Christ is born today; ox and ass before him bow, and he is in the manger now. Christ is born today! Christ is born today! 2 Good Christian friends, rejoice with heart and soul and voice; now ye hear of endless bliss: Jesus Christ was born for this! He has opened heaven’s door, and we are blest forevermore. Christ was born for this! Christ was born for this! 3 Good Christian friends, rejoice with heart and soul and voice; now ye need not fear the grave: Jesus Christ was born to save! Calls you one and calls you all to gain the everlasting hall. Christ was born to save! Christ was born to save!"
133,"O Come, All Ye Faithful","1 O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant; O come ye; O come ye to Bethlehem! Come, and behold him, born the King of angels! O come, let us adore him; O come, let us adore him; O come, let us adore him, Christ, the Lord! 2 True God from true God, Light from light eternal, born of a virgin, a mortal he comes; very God, begotten, not created! O come, let us adore him; O come, let us adore him; O come, let us adore him, Christ, the Lord! 3 Sing, choirs of angels; sing in exultation; sing, all ye citizens of heaven above! Glory to God, all glory in the highest! O come, let us adore him; O come, let us adore him; O come, let us adore him, Christ, the Lord! 4 Yea, Lord, we greet thee, born this happy morning; Jesus, to thee be all glory given; Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing! O come, let us adore him; O come, let us adore him; O come, let us adore him, Christ, the Lord!"
134,Joy to the World,"1 Joy to the world, the Lord is come! Let earth receive her king; let every heart prepare him room, and heaven and nature sing, and heaven and nature sing, and heaven, and heaven and nature sing. 2 Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns! Let all their songs employ, while fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains repeat the sounding joy, repeat the sounding joy, repeat, repeat the sounding joy. 3 No more let sins and sorrows grow, nor thorns infest the ground; he comes to make his blessings flow far as the curse is found, far as the curse is found, far as, far as the curse is found. 4 He rules the world with truth and grace, and makes the nations prove the glories of his righteousness and wonders of his love, and wonders of his love, and wonders, wonders of his love."
135,There's a Star in the East,"1 There’s a star in the east on Christmas morn. Rise up, shepherd, and follow. It will lead to the place where the Christ was born. Rise up, shepherd, and follow. Refrain Follow, follow; rise up, shepherd, and follow. Follow the star of Bethlehem. Rise up, shepherd, and follow. 2 If you take good heed to the angel’s words, rise up, shepherd, and follow. You’ll forget your flocks, you’ll forget your herds. Rise up, shepherd, and follow.	(Refrain)"
136,"Go, Tell It on the Mountain","Refrain: Go, tell it on the mountain, over the hills and everywhere; go, tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born! 1 While shepherds kept their watching o’er silent flocks by night, behold, throughout the heavens there shone a holy light.	(Refrain) 2 The shepherds feared and trembled when lo! above the earth rang out the angel chorus that hailed our Savior’s birth. 	(Refrain) 3 Down in a lowly manger the humble Christ was born, and God sent us salvation that blessed Christmas morn. 	(Refrain)"
137,He Came Down,He came down that we may have love; he came down that we may have love; he came down that we may have love; hallelujah forevermore. (Additional stanzas) … that we may have light … that we may have peace … that we may have joy
138,Who Would Think that What Was Needed,"1 Who would think that what was needed to transform and save the earth might not be a plan or army, proud in purpose, proved in worth? Who would think, despite derision, that a child should lead the way? God surprises earth with heaven, coming here on Christmas Day. 2 Shepherds watch and wise men wonder; monarchs scorn and angels sing; such a place as none would reckon hosts a holy helpless thing. Stable beasts and by-passed strangers watch a baby laid in hay; God surprises earth with heaven, coming here on Christmas Day. 3 Centuries of skill and science span the past from which we move, yet experience questions whether, with such progress, we improve. While the human lot we ponder, lest our hopes and humor fray, God surprises earth with heaven, coming here on Christmas Day."
139,That Boy-Child of Mary,"Refrain: That boy-child of Mary was born in a stable, a manger his cradle in Bethlehem. 1 What shall we call him, child of the manger? What name is given in Bethlehem? 	(Refrain) 2 His name is Jesus, God ever with us, God given for us in Bethlehem. 	(Refrain) 3 How can he save us; how can he help us, born here among us in Bethlehem? 	(Refrain) 4 Gift of the Father, to human mother, makes him our brother of Bethlehem. 	(Refrain) 5 One with the Father, he is our Savior, heaven-sent helper of Bethlehem. 	(Refrain) 6 Gladly we praise him, love and adore him, give ourselves to him of Bethlehem. 	(Refrain)"
140,Once in Royal David's City,"1 Once in royal David’s city stood a lowly cattle shed, where a mother laid her baby in a manger for his bed: Mary was that mother mild; Jesus Christ, her little child. 2 He came down to earth from heaven who is God and Lord of all, and his shelter was a stable, and his cradle was a stall; with the poor and meek and lowly, lived on earth our Savior holy. 3 Jesus is our childhood’s pattern; day by day like us he grew; he was little, weak and helpless; tears and smiles like us he knew; and he feels for all our sadness, and he shares in all our gladness. 4 And our eyes at last shall see him, through his own redeeming love; for that child so dear and gentle is our Lord in heaven above; and he leads his children on to the place where he is gone."
141,On This Day Earth Shall Ring,"1 On this day earth shall ring with the song children sing to the Lord, Christ our King, born on earth to save us; him the Father gave us. Ideo, ideo, ideo gloria in excelsis Deo! 2 His the doom, ours the mirth; when he came down to earth Bethlehem saw his birth; ox and ass beside him from the cold would hide him. Ideo, ideo, ideo gloria in excelsis Deo! 3 God’s bright star, o’er his head, wise men three to him led; kneel they low by his bed, lay their gifts before him, praise him and adore him. Ideo, ideo, ideo gloria in excelsis Deo! 4 On this day angels sing; with their song earth shall ring, praising Christ, heaven’s King, born on earth to save us; peace and love he gave us. Ideo, ideo, ideo gloria in excelsis Deo!"
142,Twas in the Moon of Wintertime,"1 ’Twas in the moon of wintertime, when all the birds had fled, Great Spirit, Lord of all the earth sent angel choirs instead. Before their light the stars grew dim and wandering hunters heard the hymn: Jesus, your king, is born; Jesus is born. In excelsis gloria. 2 Within a lodge of broken bark the tender babe was found. A ragged robe of rabbit skin enwrapped his beauty round. But as the hunters brave drew nigh the angel song rang loud and high: Jesus, your king, is born; Jesus is born. In excelsis gloria. 3 The earliest moon of wintertime is not so round and fair as was the ring of glory on the helpless infant there. The chiefs from far before him knelt with gifts of fox and beaver pelt. Jesus, your king, is born; Jesus is born. In excelsis gloria. 4 O children of the forest free, the angel song is true: the holy child of earth and heaven is born today for you. Come kneel before the radiant boy who brings you beauty, peace, and joy. Jesus, your king, is born; Jesus is born. In excelsis gloria."
143,"Angels, from the Realms of Glory","1 Angels, from the realms of glory, wing your flight o’er all the earth; you, who sang creation’s story, now proclaim Messiah’s birth: come and worship, come and worship, worship Christ, the newborn king! 2 Shepherds, in the fields abiding, watching o’er your flocks by night, God with us is now residing; yonder shines the infant light: come and worship, come and worship, worship Christ, the newborn king! 3 Sages, leave your contemplations; brighter visions beam afar; seek the great desire of nations; you have seen his natal star: come and worship, come and worship, worship Christ, the newborn king! 4 All creation, join in praising God the Father, Spirit, Son, evermore your voices raising to the eternal Three in One: come and worship, come and worship, worship Christ, the newborn king!"
144,In the Bleak Midwinter,"1 In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan; earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone; snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow, in the bleak midwinter, long ago. 2 Our God, heaven cannot hold him, nor earth sustain; heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign: in the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed the Lord God incarnate, Jesus Christ. 3 Angels and archangels may have gathered there; cherubim and seraphim thronged the air; but his mother only, in her maiden bliss, worshiped the beloved with a kiss. 4 What can I give him, poor as I am? If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb; if I were a wise man, I would do my part; yet what I can I give him: give my heart."
145,What Child Is This,"1 What child is this, who, laid to rest, on Mary’s lap is sleeping? Whom angels greet with anthems sweet while shepherds watch are keeping? This, this is Christ the King, whom shepherds guard and angels sing; haste, haste to bring him laud, the babe, the son of Mary! 2 Why lies he in such mean estate where ox and ass are feeding? Good Christian, fear; for sinners here the silent Word is pleading. Nails, spear, shall pierce him through; the cross be borne for me, for you. Hail, hail, the Word made flesh, the babe, the son of Mary! 3 So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh; come, one and all, to own him. The King of kings salvation brings; let loving hearts enthrone him. Raise, raise the song on high. The virgin sings her lullaby. Joy, joy, for Christ is born, the babe, the son of Mary!"
146,Gentle Mary Laid Her Child,"1 Gentle Mary laid her child lowly in a manger; there he lay, the undefiled, to the world a stranger. Such a babe in such a place, can he be the Savior? Ask the saved of all the race who have found his favor. 2 Angels sang about his birth; wise men sought and found him; heaven’s star shone brightly forth, glory all around him. Shepherds saw the wondrous sight, heard the angels singing; all the plains were lit that night; all the hills were ringing. 3 Gentle Mary laid her child lowly in a manger; he is still the undefiled, but no more a stranger. Son of God, of humble birth, beautiful the story; praise his name in all the earth; hail the King of glory!"
147,The First Nowell,"1 The first Nowell the angel did say was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay, in fields where they lay keeping their sheep, on a cold winter’s night that was so deep. Refrain: Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, born is the King of Israel. 2 They looked up and saw a star shining in the east beyond them far; and to the earth it gave great light, and so it continued both day and night. 	(Refrain) 3 And by the light of that same star three wise men came from country far; to seek for a king was their intent, and to follow the star wherever it went. 	(Refrain) 4 This star drew nigh to the northwest; o’er Bethlehem it took its rest, and there it did both stop and stay, right over the place where Jesus lay. 	(Refrain) 5 Then entered in those wise men three, full reverently upon their knee, and offered there in his presence their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense. 	(Refrain) 6 Then let us all with one accord sing praises to our heavenly Lord, that hath made heaven and earth of nought, and with his blood our life hath bought. 	(Refrain)"
148,Mary and Joseph Came to the Temple,"1 Mary and Joseph came to the temple brought the boy Jesus, offered him there. People were waiting wanting to greet him; long had they sought him, solace for care. 2 Anna had prayed there, widowed, long waiting, worshiping God by day and by night. Now she is praising, filled with elation: here is God's promise, Christ is her light. 3 Simeon sings now: God proffers blessing, brilliantly gilding dawn of his day. Light in the darkness, never extinguished, Light of all nations, light up our way."
149,All Hail to God's Anointed,"1 All hail to God’s anointed, great David’s greater Son! All hail, in time appointed, your reign on earth begun! You come to break oppression, to set the captive free, to take away transgression and rule in equity. 2 You come with rescue speedy to those who suffer wrong, to help the poor and needy and bid the weak be strong; to give them songs for sighing, their darkness turn to light, whose souls, condemned and dying, are precious in your sight. 3 You shall come down like showers upon the fruitful earth; love, joy, and hope, like flowers, spring in your path to birth. Before you on the mountains shall peace, the herald, go, and righteousness in fountains from hill to valley flow. 4 All rulers bow before you, and gold and incense bring. All nations shall adore you; your praise all people sing. To you shall prayer unceasing and daily vows ascend. Your rule is still increasing; your rule is without end."
150,As with Gladness Men of Old,"1 As with gladness men of old did the guiding star behold; as with joy they hailed its light, leading onward, beaming bright; so, most gracious Lord, may we evermore be led to thee. 2 As with joyful steps they sped, Savior, to thy lowly bed, there to bend the knee before thee, whom heaven and earth adore; so may we with willing feet ever seek thy mercy seat. 3 As they offered gifts most rare at thy manger, rude and bare, so may we with holy joy, pure and free from sin’s alloy, all our costliest treasures bring, Christ, to thee, our heavenly king. 4 Holy Jesus, every day keep us in the narrow way; and when earthly things are past, bring our ransomed souls at last where they need no star to guide, where no clouds thy glory hide."
151,We Three Kings of Orient Are,"1 We three kings of Orient are; bearing gifts we traverse afar, field and fountain, moor and mountain, following yonder star. Refrain: O star of wonder, star of night, star with royal beauty bright, westward leading, still proceeding, guide us to thy perfect light! 2 Born a King on Bethlehem’s plain, gold I bring to crown him again, King forever, ceasing never over us all to reign. 	(Refrain) 3 Frankincense to offer have I; incense owns a deity nigh; prayer and praising gladly raising, worshiping God Most High. 	(Refrain) 4 Myrrh is mine; its bitter perfume breathes a life of gathering gloom; sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying, sealed in the stone-cold tomb. 	(Refrain) 5 Glorious now behold him arise, King and God and Sacrifice: Alleluia! Alleluia! sounds through the earth and skies. 	(Refrain)"
152,"What Star Is This, with Beams So Bright","1 What star is this, with beams so bright, more lovely than the noonday light? ’Tis sent to announce a newborn king, glad tidings of our God to bring. 2 ’Tis now fulfilled what God decreed, “From Jacob shall a star proceed”; and lo! the eastern sages stand to read in heaven the Lord’s command. 3 While outward signs the star displays, an inward light the Lord conveys and urges them, with tender might, to seek the giver of the light. 4 O Jesus, while the star of grace impels us on to seek your face, let not our slothful hearts refuse the guidance of your light to use."
153,In Bethlehem a Newborn Boy,"1 In Bethlehem a newborn boy was hailed with songs of praise and joy. Then warning came of danger near: King Herod’s troops would soon appear. 2 The soldiers sought the child in vain: not yet was he to share our pain; but down the ages rings the cry of those who saw their children die. 3 Still rage the fires of hate today, and innocents the price must pay, while aching hearts in every land cry out, “We cannot understand!” 4 Lord Jesus, through our night of loss shines out the wonder of your cross, the love that cannot cease to bear our human anguish everywhere. 5 May that great love our lives control and conquer hate in every soul, till, pledged to build and not destroy, we share your pain and find your joy."
154,Jesus Entered Egypt,"1 Jesus entered Egypt fleeing Herod's hand, living as an alien in a foreign land. Far from home and country with his family, was there room and welcome for this refugee? 2 Jesus was a migrant living as a guest with the friends and strangers who could offer rest. Do we hold wealth lightly so that we can share shelter with the homeless, and abundant care? 3 Jesus crosses borders with the wandering poor, searching for a refuge, for an open door. Do our words and actions answer Jesus' plea: ""Give the lowly welcome, and you welcome me""?"
155,Raise a Song of Gladness,"Raise a song of gladness, peoples of the earth. Christ has come, bringing peace, joy to every heart. Alleluia, alleluia, joy to every heart! Alleluia, alleluia, joy to every heart! Jubilate Deo omnis terra. Servite Domino in laetitia. Alleluia, alleluia, in laetitia! Alleluia, alleluia, in laetitia!"
156,Sing of God Made Manifest,"1 Sing of God made manifest in a child robust and blest, to whose home in Bethlehem where a star had guided them, magi came and gifts unbound, signs mysterious and profound: myrrh and frankincense and gold grave and God and king foretold. 2 Sing of God made manifest when at Jordan John confessed, “I should be baptized by you, but your bidding I will do.” Then from heaven a double sign— dove-like Spirit, voice divine— hailed the true Anointed One: “This is my beloved Son.” 3 Sing of God made manifest when Christ came as wedding guest and at Cana gave a sign, turning water into wine; further still was love revealed as he taught, forgave, and healed, bringing light and life to all who would listen to God’s call. 4 Sing of God made manifest on the cloud-capped mountain’s crest, where the law and prophets waned so that Christ alone remained: glimpse of glory, pledge of grace, given as Jesus set his face towards the waiting cross and grave, sign of hope that God would save."
157,I Danced in the Morning,"1 I danced in the morning when the world was begun, and I danced in the moon and the stars and the sun, and I came down from heaven and I danced on the earth. At Bethlehem I had my birth. Refrain: Dance, then, wherever you may be; I am the Lord of the Dance, said he, and I'll lead you all, wherever you may be, and I'll lead you all in the dance, said he. 2 I danced for the scribe and the Pharisee, but they would not dance and they would not follow me. I danced for the fishermen, for James and John. They came with me and the dance went on.	(Refrain) 3 I danced on the Sabbath and I cured the lame. The holy people said it was a shame. They whipped and they stripped and they hung me high, and left me there on a cross to die. 	(Refrain) 4 I danced on a Friday when the sky turned black. It's hard to dance with the devil on your back. They buried my body and they thought I'd gone, but I am the dance and I still go on. 	(Refrain) 5 They cut me down and I leapt up high. I am the life that will never, never die. I'll live in you if you'll live in me, I am the Lord of the Dance, said he. 	(Refrain)"
158,"Born in the Night, Mary's Child","1 Born in the night, Mary's Child, a long way from your home; coming in need, Mary's Child, born in a borrowed room. 2 Clear shining light, Mary's Child, your face lights up our way; Light of the world, Mary's Child, dawn on our darkened day. 3 Truth of our life, Mary's Child, you tell us God is good; yes, it is true, Mary's Child, shown on your cross of wood. 4 Hope of the world, Mary's Child, you're coming soon to reign; King of the earth, Mary's Child, walk in our streets again."
159,O Sing a Song of Bethlehem,"1 O sing a song of Bethlehem, of shepherds watching there, and of the news that came to them from angels in the air. The light that shone on Bethlehem fills all the world today. Of Jesus' birth and peace on earth the angels sing alway. 2 O sing a song of Nazareth, of sunny days of joy; O sing of fragrant flowers' breath, and of the sinless boy. For now the flowers of Nazareth in every heart may grow. Now spreads the fame of his dear name on all the winds that blow. 3 O sing a song of Galilee, of lake and woods and hill, of him who walked upon the sea and bade its waves be still. For though, like waves on Galilee, dark seas of trouble roll, when faith has heard the Master's word, falls peace upon the soul. 4 O sing a song of Calvary, its glory and dismay, of him who hung upon the tree, and took our sins away. For he who died on Calvary is risen from the grave, and Christ, our Lord, by heaven adored, is mighty now to save."
160,A Stable Lamp Is Lighted,"1 A stable lamp is lighted whose glow shall wake the sky; the stars shall bend their voices, and every stone shall cry. And every stone shall cry, and straw like gold shall shine; a barn shall harbor heaven, a stall become a shrine. 2 This child through David’s city shall ride in triumph by; the palm shall strew its branches, and every stone shall cry. And every stone shall cry, though heavy, dull, and dumb, and lie within the roadway to pave his kingdom come. 3 Yet he shall be forsaken, and yielded up to die; the sky shall groan and darken, and every stone shall cry. And every stone shall cry, for hearts made hard by sin: God’s blood upon the spearhead, God’s love refused again. 4 But now, as at the ending, the low is lifted high; the stars shall bend their voices, and every stone shall cry. And every stone shall cry, in praises of the child by whose descent among us the worlds are reconciled."
161,Woman in the Night,"1 Woman in the night, spent from giving birth, guard our precious light; peace is on the earth. Woman in the crowd, creeping up behind, touching is allowed: seek and you will find! Refrain: Come and join the song, women, children, men. Jesus makes us free to live again! 2 Woman at the well, question the Messiah; find your friends and tell: drink your heart's desire! Woman at the feast, let the righteous stare; come and go in peace; love him with your hair! 	(Refrain) 3 Woman in the house, nurtured to be meek, leave your second place, listen, think, and speak! Woman on the road, from your sickness freed, witness and provide, joining word and deed: 	(Refrain) 4 Women on the hill, stand when men have fled; Christ needs loving still, though your hope is dead. Women in the dawn, care and spices bring, earliest to mourn, earliest to sing! 	(Refrain)"
162,"O Carpenter, Why Leave the Bench","1 O carpenter, why leave the bench where wood yields to your art, and take instead, to try your skill, the stony human heart? 2 O carpenter, why leave the tools to carry out your plans, and go instead to do God's work with empty, open hands? 3 O carpenter, why leave the world of of table, bed, and house, to face the empire's carpentry, to lift a Roman cross? 4 O carpenter, why leave repairs with wood and clamp and glue, and rise from death to seek instead to make the whole world new? 5 O carpenter, who else could do the work that you have done? What can we do but sing your praise, O Savior, Mary's son!"
163,Wild and Lone the Prophet's Voice,"1 Wild and lone the prophet's voice echoes through the desert still, calling us to make a choice, bidding us to do God's will: ""Turn from sin and be baptized; cleanse your heart and mind and soul. Quitting all the sins you prized, yield your life to God's control. 2 ""Bear the fruit repentance sows: lives of justice, truth and love. Trust no other claim than those; set your heart on things above. Soon the Lord will come in power, burning clean the threshing floor: then will flames the chaff devour; wheat alone shall fill God's store."" 3 With such preaching, stark and bold, John proclaimed salvation near, and his timeless warnings hold words of hope to all who hear. So we dare to journey on, led by faith through ways untrod, till we come at last like John to behold the Lamb of God."
164,Down Galilee's Slow Roadways,"1 Down Galilee’s slow roadways a stranger traveled on from Nazareth to Jordan to be baptized by John. He went down to the waters like soldier, scribe, and slave, but there within the river the sign was birth and grave. 2 Arising from the river he saw the heavens torn; it seemed the sky so open revealed the Spirit’s form. The holy dove descended amid a glorious voice: “You are my own beloved, my child, my heart, my choice.” 3 We too have found a roadway; it led us to this place. We all have had to travel in search of hope and grace. But now beside this water again a voice is heard. “You are my own, my chosen, beloved of your Lord.”"
165,The Glory of These Forty Days,"1 The glory of these forty days we celebrate with songs of praise; for Christ, by whom all things were made, himself has fasted and has prayed. 2 Alone and fasting Moses saw the loving God who gave the law; and to Elijah, fasting, came the steeds and chariots of flame. 3 So Daniel trained his mystic sight, delivered from the lions’ might; and John, the Bridegroom’s friend, became the herald of Messiah’s name. 4 Then grant that we like them be true, consumed in fast and prayer with you; our spirits strengthen with your grace, and give us joy to see your face."
166,"Lord, Who Throughout These Forty Days","1 Lord, who throughout these forty days for us did fast and pray, teach us with you to mourn our sins and close by you to stay. 2 As you with Satan did contend and did the victory win, O give us strength to persevere, in you to conquer sin. 3 And through these days of penitence, and through this Passiontide, yes, evermore, in life and death, O Lord, with us abide. 4 Abide with us, till when this life of suffering shall be past, an Easter of unending joy we may attain at last."
167,Forty Days and Forty Nights,"1 Forty days and forty nights you were fasting in the wild; forty days and forty nights tempted, and yet undefiled. 2 Shall not we your sorrow share and from worldly joys abstain, fasting with unceasing prayer, strong with you to suffer pain? 3 Then if Satan on us press, flesh or spirit to assail, victor in the wilderness, grant that we not faint nor fail! 4 So shall we have peace divine: holier gladness ours shall be; round us, too, shall angels shine, such as served you faithfully. 5 Keep, O keep us, Savior dear, ever constant by your side, that with you we may appear at the eternal Eastertide."
168,"Within Your Shelter, Loving God","1 Within your shelter, loving God, my refuge and my tower, I safely walk by day and night beneath your guiding power. 2 Because I trust in you alone, no evil shall come near. The strong defender of my home, with you I have no fear. 3 Your holy angels bear me up and keep my feet secure. Though fierce and angry foes assail, in you my way is sure. 4 As often as I call to you, you kindly hear my prayer. In times of trouble and distress I rest in your own care. 5 All those who know your name on earth shall life abundant know. On all abiding in your love your saving grace bestow."
169,Dear Lord and Father of Mankind,"1 *Dear Lord and Father of mankind, forgive our foolish ways; reclothe us in our rightful mind, in purer lives thy service find, in deeper reverence, praise. 2 In simple trust like theirs who heard beside the Syrian sea the gracious calling of the Lord, let us, like them, without a word rise up and follow thee. 3 O Sabbath rest by Galilee, O calm of hills above, where Jesus knelt to share with thee the silence of eternity, interpreted by love! 4 Drop thy still dews of quietness, till all our strivings cease; take from our souls the strain and stress, and let our ordered lives confess the beauty of thy peace. 5 Breathe through the heats of our desire thy coolness and thy balm; let sense be dumb, let flesh retire; speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire, O still, small voice of calm! *Or ""Dear Lord, Creator good and kind"""
170,You Walk along Our Shoreline,"1 You walk along our shoreline where land meets unknown sea. We hear your voice of power, “Now come and follow me. And if you still will follow through storm and wave and shoal, then I will make you fishers but of the human soul.” 2 You call us, Christ, to gather the people of the earth. We cannot fish for only those lives we think have worth. We spread your net of gospel across the water’s face, our boat a common shelter for all found by your grace. 3 We cast our net, O Jesus; we cry the kingdom’s name; we work for love and justice; we learn to hope through pain. You call us, Lord, to gather God’s daughters and God’s sons, to let your judgment heal us so that all may be one."
171,A Sower Came from Ancient Hills,"1 A Sower came from ancient hills and cast good seed abroad: his field, ten thousand human hearts; his seed, the word of God. And some who listened would not hear, and some who heard forgot. But some received in fertile soil the truth the Sower taught. 2 A Sower walked throughout the land and, everywhere he trod, he sowed his life because he was himself the Seed of God. But then, atop a barren hill, beneath a darkening sky, they threw God’s Seed on stony ground and left it there to die. 3 The Seed was buried deep in death beneath a blood-red sky, and deeper still was buried hope for those who watched him die. But then, in Joseph’s garden fair, as dawn broke o’er the land, the Seed, from three days’ silent sleep, awoke at God’s command! 4 O Christ, you come among us still, the Sower and the Seed. As once you sowed the truth of God in glowing word and deed, implant your Word in waiting hearts, and let it there take hold, until it bears in fruitful lives a harvest hundredfold."
172,Blest Are They,"1 Blest are they, the poor in spirit; theirs is the kingdom of God. Blest are they, full of sorrow; they shall be consoled. Refrain: Rejoice and be glad! Blessed are you; holy are you! Rejoice and be glad! Yours is the kingdom of God! 2 Blest are they, the lowly ones; they shall inherit the earth. Blest are they who hunger and thirst; they shall have their fill. 	(Refrain) 3 Blest are they who show mercy; mercy shall be theirs. Blest are they, the pure of heart; they shall see God. 	(Refrain) 4 Blest are they who seek peace; they are the children of God. Blest are they who suffer in faith; the glory of God is theirs. 	(Refrain) 5 Blest are you who suffer hate, all because of me. Rejoice, be glad; yours is the kingdom; shine for all to see. 	(Refrain)"
173,A Woman and a Coin,"1 A woman and a coin: the coin is lost! How much it means to her, what time and toil, what part it was to play in her bright dreams! Am I that treasured coin worth searching for? I’m found, and you rejoice! What love! What love! 2 A shepherd and a sheep: the sheep is lost! Far from the flock, the one in hundred cries, then, risking life, the shepherd’s voice and staff! Am I that treasured sheep worth dying for? I live, and you rejoice! What love! What love! 3 A parent and a child: the child is lost! The parent feeds on memories and hope, the prodigal on husks and one last chance. Am I that treasured child worth waiting for? I’m home, and you rejoice! What love! What love! 4 Dear God, you sought us when the world was lost; you gave your only son at what a cost; your Spirit welcomes home the tempest-tossed: now we can be all you were dreaming of. We’re safe, and you rejoice! What love! What love!"
174,Come and Seek the Ways of Wisdom,"1 Come and seek the ways of Wisdom, she who danced when earth was new. Follow closely what she teaches, for her words are right and true. Wisdom clears the path to justice, showing us what love must do. 2 Listen to the voice of Wisdom, crying in the marketplace. Hear the Word made flesh among us, full of glory, truth, and grace. When the word takes root and ripens, peace and righteousness embrace. 3 Sister Wisdom, come, assist us; nurture all who seek rebirth. Spirit-guide and close companion, bring to light our sacred worth. Free us to become your people, holy friends of God and earth."
175,Seek Ye First,"1 Seek ye first the kingdom of God and its righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you. Allelu, alleluia! 2 Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and the door shall be opened unto you. Allelu, alleluia! 3 You shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God. Allelu, alleluia!"
176,If You Only Had Faith,"If you only had faith, just like a little seed of mustard: this is what Jesus has said. You would be able to tell this mountain: Move away!  Move away! And then the mountain will move away, will move away, will move away. Si tuvieras fe como un granito de mostaza: eso lo dice el Señor. Tú le dirías a esa montaña: ¡muévete, muévete! Y la montaña se moverá, se moverá, se moverá."
177,I Will Come to You,"1 “I will come to you in the silence; I will lift you from all your fear. You will hear my voice; I claim you as my choice. Be still and know I am here. Refrain: ""Do not be afraid, I am with you. I have called you each by name. Come and follow me, I will bring you home; I love you and you are mine.” 2 “I am hope for all who are hopeless; I am eyes for all who long to see. In the shadows of the night, I will be your light. Come and rest in me. 	(Refrain) 3 “I am strength for all the despairing, healing for the ones who dwell in shame. All the blind will see; the lame will all run free, and all will know my name. 	(Refrain) 4 “I am the Word that leads all to freedom; I am the peace the world cannot give. I will call your name, embracing all your pain. Stand up, now walk and live! 	(Refrain)"
178,The Woman Hiding in the Crowd,"1 The woman hiding in the crowd reached for Christ's garment hem that simply by the touch of it she might be healed within. 2 From Christ went forth the healing grace, her health and life restored. ""Who touched my clothes?"" the Savior asked, but no one said a word. 3 The woman knelt before him then with joy and anxious fear, and Jesus blessed her lovingly: ""In peace go forth from here."" 4 The burdens now that weigh us down, the sins we fear to speak, the ache of heart and empty soul we lay before your feet. 5 So touch us, Lord, with healing grace and make us whole again that we may always live in you and know your peace within."
179,Ten Lepers Facing Constant Scorn,"1 Ten lepers facing constant scorn, emboldened by their daily plight, encountered One whose healing touch was known to put disease to flight. The ten outsiders sought relief: ""Have mercy, Master, hear our plea."" ""Seek out the priests,"" the Healer said. He knew the walk could set them free. 2 A nameless junction in the road became a holy turn-about. One awestruck convert spun around and, praising God, began to shout. God gave the space to turn around to all the others on the way, but only one resolved to seize the miracle of grace that day. 3 Would we have stopped, retraced our steps, and then embraced the living Lord whose word had banished all our sores? What kind of thanks would we afford? God, make of us your living tithes; the first fruits, fit to work for you. Let each be like that one in ten: transformed and cleansed, restored, made new."
180,"Silence! Frenzied, Unclean Spirit","1 ""Silence! Frenzied, unclean spirit,"" cried God's healing, Holy One. ""Cease your ranting! Flesh can't bear it. Flee as night before the sun."" At Christ's voice the demon trembled, from its victim madly rushed, while the crowd that was assembled stood in wonder, stunned, and hushed. 2 Lord, the demons still are thriving in the gray cells of the mind: tyrant voices, shrill and driving, twisted thoughts that grip and bind, doubts that stir the heart to panic, fears distorting reason's sight, guilt that makes our loving frantic, dreams that cloud the soul with fright. 3 Silence, Lord, the unclean spirit, in our mind and in our heart. Speak your word that when we hear it all our demons shall depart. Clear our thought and calm our feeling; still the fractured, warring soul. By the power of your healing make us faithful, true, and whole."
181,"Silence! Frenzied, Unclean Spirit","1 ""Silence! Frenzied, unclean spirit,"" cried God's healing, Holy One. ""Cease your ranting! Flesh can't bear it. Flee as night before the sun."" At Christ's voice the demon trembled, from its victim madly rushed, while the crowd that was assembled stood in wonder, stunned, and hushed. 2 Lord, the demons still are thriving in the gray cells of the mind: tyrant voices, shrill and driving, twisted thoughts that grip and bind, doubts that stir the heart to panic, fears distorting reason's sight, guilt that makes our loving frantic, dreams that cloud the soul with fright. 3 Silence, Lord, the unclean spirit, in our mind and in our heart. Speak your word that when we hear it all our demons shall depart. Clear our thought and calm our feeling; still the fractured, warring soul. By the power of your healing make us faithful, true, and whole."
182,I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say,"1 I heard the voice of Jesus say, “Come unto me and rest; lay down, O weary one, lay down your head upon my breast.” I came to Jesus as I was, so weary, worn, and sad; I found him in a resting place, and he has made me glad. 2 I heard the voice of Jesus say, “Behold, I freely give the living water, thirsty one; stoop down and drink and live.” I came to Jesus, and I drank of that life-giving stream; my thirst was quenched, my soul revived, and now I live in him. 3 I heard the voice of Jesus say, “I am this dark world’s light; look unto me, your morn shall rise, and all your day be bright.” I looked to Jesus, and I found in him my star, my sun; and in that light of life I’ll walk till traveling days are done."
183,"Come to Me, O Weary Traveler","1 “Come to me, O weary traveler; come to me with your distress; come to me, you heavy burdened; come to me and find your rest.” 2 “Do not fear, my yoke is easy; do not fear, my burden's light; do not fear the path before you; do not run from me in fright.” 3 “Take my yoke and leave your troubles; take my yoke and come with me. Take my yoke, I am beside you; take and learn humility.” 4 “Rest in me, O weary traveler; rest in me and do not fear. Rest in me, my heart is gentle; rest and cast away your care.”"
184,Calm to the Waves,"Calm to the waves. Calm to the wind. Jesus whispers, “Peace, be still.” Balm to our hearts. Fears at an end. In stillness, hear his voice."
185,Lonely the Boat,Lonely the Boat 캄캄한 밤 캄캄한 밤 사-나운 바-람 불--때	만경창파 망-망한 바-다에 외로운배 한-척이 떠-나가니 		아- 위태하구나 위-태하구나 비바람이 무-섭게 몰-아치--고		그 놀란물 큰- 파도 일-때에 저뱃사공 어-쩔줄 몰-라하니		아- 가련하구나 가-련하구나 절망중에 그- 사공 떨-면서--도		한 줄기의 밝-은빛 보-고서 배안에도 하-나님 계-심믿고		오- 기도올린다 기-도올린다 아버지여 이- 죄인 굽-어보--사		성난풍랑 잔-잔케 하-시고 이불쌍한 인-생을 살-리소서		오- 우리 하나님 우-리 하나님 모진바람 또- 험한 큰- 물결--이 	제아무리 성-내어 덮-쳐도 권능의 손 그- 노를 저-으시니		오- 맑은 바다라 맑-은 바다라
186,"Come Now, You Blessed, Eat at My Table","1 ""Come now, you blessed, eat at my table,"" said Jesus Christ to the righteous above. ""When I was hungry, thirsty, and homeless, sick and in prison, you showed me your love."" 2 When did we see you hungry or thirsty? When were you homeless, a stranger alone? When did we see you sick or in prison? What have we done that you call us your own? 3 ""When you gave bread to earth's hungry children, when you gave shelter to war's refugees, when you remembered those most forgotten, you cared for me in the smallest of these."" 4 Christ, when we see you out on life's roadways, looking to us in the faces of need, then may we know you, welcome, and show you love that is faithful in word and in deed."
187,"Savior, like a Shepherd Lead Us","1 Savior, like a shepherd lead us; much we need your tender care. In your pleasant pastures feed us; for our use your fold prepare. Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, you have bought us: we are yours. Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, you have bought us: we are yours. 2 We are yours: in love befriend us; be the guardian of our way. Keep your flock: from sin defend us; seek us when we go astray. Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, hear your children when we pray. Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, hear your children when we pray. 3 You have promised to receive us, poor and sinful though we be; you have mercy to relieve us, grace to cleanse, and power to free. Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, early let us turn to you. Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, early let us turn to you. 4 Early let us seek your favor; early let us do your will. Blessed Lord and only Savior, with your love our spirits fill. Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, you have loved us; love us still. Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, you have loved us; love us still."
188,Jesus Loves Me!,"1 Jesus loves me! This I know, for the Bible tells me so. Little ones to him belong. They are weak, but he is strong. Yes, Jesus loves me! Yes, Jesus loves me! Yes, Jesus loves me! The Bible tells me so. 2 Jesus loves me! This I know, as he loved so long ago, taking children on his knee, saying, ""Let them come to me."" Yes, Jesus loves me! Yes, Jesus loves me! Yes, Jesus loves me! The Bible tells me so."
189,"O Wondrous Sight, O Vision Fair","1 O wondrous sight, O vision fair of glory that the church shall share, which Christ upon the mountain shows, where brighter than the sun he glows! 2 From age to age the tale declare, how with the three disciples there, where Moses and Elijah meet, the Lord holds converse high and sweet. 3 The law and prophets there have place, two chosen witnesses of grace; the Father's voice from out the cloud proclaims his only Son aloud. 4 With shining face and bright array Christ deigns to manifest today what glory shall be theirs above who joy in God with perfect love. 5 And faithful hearts are raised on high by this great vision's mystery, for which in joyful strains we raise the voice of prayer, the hymn of praise."
190,Swiftly Pass the Clouds of Glory,"1 Swiftly pass the clouds of glory, heaven's voice, the dazzling light; Moses and Elijah vanish; Christ alone commands the height! Peter, James, and John fall silent, turning from the summit's rise downward toward the shadowed valley where their Lord has fixed his eyes. 2 Glimpsed and gone the revelation, they shall gain and keep its truth, not by building on the mountain any shrine or sacred booth, but by following the Savior through the valley to the cross and by testing faith's resilience through betrayal, pain, and loss. 3 Lord, transfigure our perception with the purest light that shines, and recast our life's intentions to the shape of your designs, till we seek no other glory than what lies past Calvary's hill and our living and our dying and our rising by your will."
191,We Have Come at Christ's Own Bidding,"1 We have come at Christ’s own bidding to this high and holy place, where we wait with hope and longing for some token of God’s grace. Here we pray for new assurance that our faith is not in vain, searching like those first disciples for a sign both clear and plain. 2 Light breaks through our clouds and shadows; splendor bathes the flesh-joined Word; Moses and Elijah marvel as the heavenly voice is heard. Eyes and hearts behold with wonder how the law and prophets meet: Christ, with garments drenched in brightness, stands transfigured and complete. 3 Strengthened by this glimpse of glory, fearful lest our faith decline, we like Peter find it tempting to remain and build a shrine. But true worship gives us courage to proclaim what we profess, that our daily lives may prove us people of the God we bless."
192,"Lord, the Light of Your Love Is Shining","1 Lord, the light of your love is shining, in the midst of the darkness, shining; Jesus, Light of the World, shine upon us; set us free by the truth you now bring us. Shine on me; shine on me. Refrain Shine, Jesus, shine; fill this land with the Father’s glory. Blaze, Spirit, blaze; set our hearts on fire. Flow, river, flow; flood the nations with grace and mercy. Send forth your word, Lord, and let there be light. 2 Lord, I come to your awesome presence, from the shadows into your radiance; by the blood I may enter your brightness. Search me; try me; consume all my darkness. Shine on me; shine on me. 	(Refrain) 3 As we gaze on your kingly brightness, so our faces display your likeness; ever changing from glory to glory, mirrored here may our lives tell your story. Shine on me; shine on me. 	(Refrain)"
193,"Jesus, Take Us to the Mountain","1 Jesus, take us to the mountain, where, with Peter, James, and John, we are dazzled by your glory, light as blinding as the sun. There prepare us for the night by the vision of that sight. 2 What do you want us to see there, that your close companions saw? Your divinity revealed there fills us with the selfsame awe. Clothed in flesh like ours you go, matched to meet our deadliest foe. 3 What do you want us to hear there, that your dear disciples heard? Once again the voice from heaven says of the Incarnate Word, ""Listen, listen, everyone: this is my beloved Son."" 4 Take us to that other mountain where we see you glorified, where you shouted ""It is finished!"" where for all the world you died. Hear the stunned centurion: ""Truly this was God's own Son!"" 5 We who have beheld your glory, risen and ascended Lord, cannot help but tell the story, all that we have seen and heard; say with Peter, James, and John: ""You are God's beloved Son!"""
194,When Jesus Wept,"When Jesus wept, the falling tear in mercy flowed beyond all bound. When Jesus groaned, a trembling fear seized all the guilty world around."
195,When Twilight Comes,"1 When twilight comes and the sun sets, mother hen prepares for night's rest. As her brood shelters under her wings she gives the love of God to her nest. O! what joy to feel her warm heart beat and be near her all night long; so the young can find repose, then renew tomorrow's song. 2 One day the Rabbi, Lord Jesus, called the twelve to share his last meal. As the hen tends her young, so for them he spent himself to seek and to heal. O! what joy to be with Christ Jesus, hear his voice, O! sheer delight, and receive his servant care, all before the coming night. 3 So gather round once again, friends, touched by fading glow of sun's gold, and recount all our frail human hopes, the dreams of young and stories of old. O! what joy to pray close together, kneeling as one family, by a mother's love embraced in the blessed Trinity."
196,"All Glory, Laud, and Honor","Refrain: All glory, laud, and honor to thee, Redeemer, King, to whom the lips of children made sweet hosannas ring! 1 Thou art the King of Israel, thou David’s royal Son, who in the Lord’s name comest, the King and blessed One. (Refrain) 2 The people of the Hebrews with palms before thee went; our praise and prayers and anthems before thee we present. (Refrain) 3 To thee, before thy passion, they sang their hymns of praise; to thee, now high exalted, our melody we raise. (Refrain) 4 Thou didst accept their praises; accept the prayers we bring, who in all good delightest, thou good and gracious King! (Refrain)"
197,"Hosanna, Loud Hosanna","1 Hosanna, loud hosanna, the little children sang; through pillared court and temple the joyful anthem rang. To Jesus, who had blessed them, close folded to his breast, the children sang their praises, the simplest and the best. 2 From Olivet they followed 'mid an exultant crowd, the victor palm branch waving, and chanting clear and loud; the Lord of earth and heaven rode on in lowly state, nor scorned that little children should on his bidding wait. 3 “Hosanna in the highest!” That ancient song we sing, for Christ is our Redeemer; the Lord of heaven, our King. O may we ever praise him with heart and life and voice, and in his blissful presence eternally rejoice."
198,Ride On! Ride On in Majesty!,"1 Ride on! ride on in majesty! Hark! all the tribes hosanna cry; thy humble beast pursues its road with palms and scattered garments strowed. 2 Ride on! ride on in majesty! In lowly pomp ride on to die; O Christ, thy triumphs now begin o'er captive death and conquered sin. Ride on! ride on in majesty! The hosts of angels in the sky look down with sad and wondering eyes to see the approaching sacrifice. Ride on! ride on in majesty! In lowly pomp ride on to die; bow thy meek head to mortal pain; then take, O God, thy power, and reign."
199,Filled with Excitement,"1 Filled with excitement, all the happy throng spread cloaks and branches on the city streets. There in the distance they begin to see, there on a donkey comes the Savior Christ. (Refrain) From every corner a thousand voices sing praise to the One who comes in the name of God. Our acclamation breaks forth in shouts of praise, our triumphant song of joy: “Hosanna, hosanna to Christ! Hosanna, hosanna to Christ!” 2 As in that entrance to Jerusalem, hosannas we will sing to Jesus Christ, to our Redeemer who still calls today, asks us to follow with our love and faith. 1 Mantos y palmas esparciendo va el pueblo_alegre de Jerusalén. Allá_a lo lejos se vislumbra ya en un pollino_al Salvador Jesús. (Estribillo) Mientras mil voces resuenan por doquier; hosanna_al que viene_en el nombre de Dios. Con un aliento de gran exclamación prorrumpen con voz triunfal: “¡Hosana! ¡Hosana al rey!” “¡Hosana! ¡Hosana al rey!” 2 Como_en la_entrada de Jerusalén, todos cantamos a Jesús el rey, al Cristo vivo que nos llama hoy para seguirle con amor y fe."
200,"A Cheering, Chanting, Dizzy Crowd","1 A cheering, chanting, dizzy crowd had stripped the green trees bare, and hailing Christ as king aloud, waved branches in the air. 2 They laid their garments in the road and spread his path with palms and vows of lasting love bestowed with royal hymns and psalms. 3 When day dimmed down to deepening dark the crowd began to fade till only trampled leaves and bark were left from the parade. 4 Lest we be fooled because our hearts have surged with passing praise, remind us, God, as this week starts where Christ has fixed his gaze. 5 Instead of palms, a winding sheet will have to be unrolled, a carpet much more fit to greet the king a cross will hold."
201,A Prophet-Woman Broke a Jar,"1 A prophet-woman broke a jar, by Love’s divine appointing. With rare perfume she filled the room, presiding and anointing. A prophet-woman broke a jar, the sneers of scorn defying. With rare perfume she filled the room, preparing Christ for dying. 2 A faithful woman left a tomb by Love’s divine commission. She saw; she heard; she preached the Word, arising from submission. A faithful woman left a tomb, with resurrection gospel. She saw; she heard; she preached the Word, apostle to apostles. 3 Though woman-wisdom, woman-truth, for centuries were hidden, unsung, unwritten, and unheard, derided and forbidden, the Spirit’s breath, the Spirit’s fire, on free and slave descending, can tumble our dividing walls, our shame and sadness mending. 4 The Spirit knows; the Spirit calls, by Love’s divine ordaining, the friends we need, to serve and lead, their powers and gifts unchaining. The Spirit knows; the Spirit calls, from women, men and children, the friends we need, to serve and lead. Rejoice, and make them welcome!"
202,An Upper Room Did Our Lord Prepare,"1 An upper room did our Lord prepare for those he loved until the end: and his disciples still gather there to celebrate their risen friend. 2 A lasting gift Jesus gave his own: to share his bread, his loving cup. Whatever burdens may bow us down, he by his cross shall lift us up. 3 And after supper he washed their feet, for service, too, is sacrament. In Christ our joy shall be made complete: sent out to serve, as he was sent. 4 No end there is! We depart in peace. He loves beyond our uttermost: in every room in our Father's house Christ will be there, as Lord and Host."
203,"Jesu, Jesu, Fill Us with Your Love","Refrain: Jesu, Jesu, fill us with your love; show us how to serve the neighbors we have from you. 1 Kneels at the feet of his friends, silently washes their feet, Master who acts as a slave to them.	(Refrain) 2 Neighbors are wealthy and poor, varied in color and race; neighbors are near us and far away.	(Refrain) 3 These are the ones we should serve; these are the ones we should love; all these are neighbors to us and you.	(Refrain) 4 Loving puts us on our knees, willing to wash others’ feet; this is the way we should live like you.	(Refrain)"
204,Stay with Me,Stay with me; remain here with me; watch and pray. Watch and pray.
205,Live in Charity,"Live in charity and steadfast love. Live in charity; God will dwell with you. Ubi caritas et amor, ubi caritas Deus ibi est."
206,This Is the Night,"1 This is the night, dear friends, the night for weeping, when powers of darkness overcome the day, the night the faithful mourn the weight of evil whereby our sins the Son of Man betray. 2 This night the traitor, wolf within the sheepfold, betrays himself into his victim’s will, the Lamb of God for sacrifice preparing: sin brings about the cure for sin’s own ill. 3 This night Christ institutes his holy supper, blest food and drink for heart and soul and mind; this night injustice joins its hand to treason’s, and buys the ransom-price of humankind. 4 This night the Lord by slaves shall be arrested, he who destroys our slavery to sin; accused of crime, to criminals be given, that judgment on the righteous Judge begin. 5 O make us sharers, Savior, of your Passion, that we may share your glory that shall be; let us pass through these three dark nights of sorrow to Easter’s laughter and its liberty."
207,Sharing Paschal Bread and Wine,"1 Sharing Paschal bread and wine as the daylight ebbs away, friends at table join to dine. One of them will soon betray. Refrain: Shadows lengthen into night. 2 In a grove of olive trees underneath a darkening sky, Jesus warns as he foresees: Peter also will deny.	(Refrain) 3 In the garden, still and deep, those he asked to watch and pray, heavy-lidded, fall asleep, weary from the anxious day. 	(Refrain) 4 Deeper in the garden’s chill, Jesus kneels to pray alone, wrestling with God’s holy will, crying out, “Let it be done!” 	(Refrain) 5 All too soon, the silence rends, with a crash of club and sword. Judas, still received as “Friend,” with a kiss betrays his Lord. 	(Refrain) 6 Christ’s disciples, weak with fear, fail one further, stringent test— so like us, with trouble near— fleeing far at his arrest. 	(Refrain) 7 While the web of darkness grows, Jesus suffers through his trial. As the herald rooster crows, Peter speaks his third denial. 	(Refrain) 8 Lifted high upon a cross, perfect love hangs pierced with nails. All creation grieves its loss, as the very sunlight fails. 	(Refrain)"
208,O Blest Are They Who in Their Love,"1 O blest are they who in their love compassion hold for those in need; for they shall find, when faced by foes, the Lord is their defense indeed. 2 When all the evils earth can dream are cast on me, my faith to break, their rage I temper through God’s grace, and bear them boldly for God’s sake. 3 The hands which shared my broken bread, my love with their deceit repaid; and friends whose trust I counted mine have left me wounded and betrayed. 4 To me, O Lord, in mercy turn; your favor, my most treasured prize; my mouth shall sing redemption’s song, and tears of love wash clean my eyes."
209,My Song Is Love Unknown,"1 My song is love unknown, my Savior's love to me, love to the loveless shown that they might lovely be. O who am I that for my sake my Lord should take frail flesh, and die? 2 He came from heaven’s throne salvation to bestow; the world that was his own would not its Savior know. But O my Friend, my Friend indeed, who at my need his life did spend! 3 Sometimes we strew his way, and his sweet praises sing, resounding all the day hosannas to our King. Then ""Crucify!"" is all our breath, and for his death we thirst and cry. 4 Unheeding, we will have our dear Lord made away, a murderer to save, the prince of life to slay. Yet steadfast he to suffering goes, that he his foes from thence might free. 5 Here might I stay and sing, no story so divine: never was love, dear King, never was grief like thine. This is my Friend, in whose sweet praise I all my days could gladly spend."
210,"Lord, Why Have You Forsaken Me","1 Lord, why have you forsaken me, and why are you so far away from my complaint and my distress poured out before you night and day? 2 Yet you are holy, and the songs of praise of Israel are your throne; when our ancestors called on you, you saved them, rescued all your own. 3 But I am mocked and put to scorn. All those who see me laugh and say, ""You trust in God, so let us see the help of God to whom you pray."" 4 Yet you, O Lord, have been my God and only hope since I was born. With trouble near me, none can help. My Savior, leave me not forlorn."
211,"Hear, O Lord, My Plea for Justice","1 Hear, O Lord, my plea for justice; listen to my heartfelt prayer. In your just deliberation may I find redemption there. 2 Test my heart for its affliction; purify my soul with fire; let my mortal tongue speak wisdom, righteousness be my desire. 3 Keep me, Lord, in sure protection, as the apple of your eye. Shelter me beneath your shadow when my hour of death draws nigh. 4 In its wake, send vindication; to its darkness, show your face. Bring me to my resurrection clothed in garments of your grace."
212,Alas! And Did My Savior Bleed,"1 Alas! And did my Savior bleed, and did my Sovereign die! Would he devote that sacred head for sinners such as I! 2 Was it for sins that I have done he suffered on the tree? Amazing pity! Grace unknown! And love beyond degree! 3 Well might the sun in darkness hide and shut its glories in, when Christ, the great Redeemer, died for human creatures' sin. 4 But drops of grief can ne'er repay the debt of love I owe; here, Lord, I give myself away; 'tis all that I can do."
213,In the Cross of Christ I Glory,"1 In the cross of Christ I glory, towering o’er the wrecks of time; all the light of sacred story gathers round its head sublime. 2 When the woes of life o’er-take me, hopes deceive, and fears annoy, never shall the cross forsake me; lo, it glows with peace and joy. 3 When the sun of bliss is beaming light and love upon my way, from the cross the radiance streaming adds more luster to the day. 4 Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure, by the cross are sanctified; peace is there that knows no measure, joys that through all time abide. 5 In the cross of Christ I glory, towering o’er the wrecks of time; all the light of sacred story gathers round its head sublime."
214,"You Are My Refuge, Faithful God","1 You are my refuge, faithful God; you shelter me from shame. I put my spirit in your hands and call upon your name. 2 Deliver me from hidden snares, from sorrow, pain, and strife. When troubles seems to smother me, take heed, and save my life! 3 Be gracious, God, in my distress, and dry my bitter tears. My life is spent in misery; I sigh away my years. 4 I am a wretched sight to see: a broken, empty thing, with only terror all around, and deathly whispering. 5 And yet I trust in you, O God; your covenant still stands. Redeem me, in your faithful love: my life is in your hands."
215,What Wondrous Love Is This,"1 What wondrous love is this, O my soul, O my soul, what wondrous love is this, O my soul! What wondrous love is this that caused the Lord of bliss to bear the dreadful curse for my soul, for my soul, to bear the dreadful curse for my soul! 2 When I was sinking down, sinking down, sinking down, when I was sinking down, sinking down, when I was sinking down beneath God's righteous frown, Christ laid aside his crown for my soul, for my soul, Christ laid aside his crown for my soul! 3 To God and to the Lamb, I will sing, I will sing, to God and to the Lamb, I will sing; to God and to the Lamb who is the great I am, while millions join the theme, I will sing, I will sing; while millions join the theme, I will sing! 4 And when from death I’m free, I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on; and when from death I’m free, I’ll sing on; and when from death I’m free, I’ll sing and joyful be, and through eternity, I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on; and through eternity I’ll sing on."
216,Beneath the Cross of Jesus,"1 Beneath the cross of Jesus I fain would take my stand, the shadow of a mighty rock within a weary land; a home within the wilderness, a rest upon the way, from the burning of the noontide heat, and the burden of the day. 2 Upon the cross of Jesus mine eye at times can see the very dying form of One who suffered there for me; and from my stricken heart with tears two wonders I confess: the wonders of redeeming love and my unworthiness. I take, O cross, thy shadow for my abiding place; I ask no other sunshine than the sunshine of his face; content to let the world go by, to know no gain or loss, my sinful self my only shame, my glory all the cross."
217,On a Barren Hilltop,"1 On a barren hilltop just outside the walls of an ancient city as the evening falls, speaks a dying figure hanging on a tree, saying ""It is finished,"" words of victory. 2 Tested just as we are, in a world of strife, through the pain and conflict of a human life, here at last completed with his final breath is a life triumphant over sin and death. 3 Let us then come boldly to the heavenly throne, where our human weakness is so fully known, and the mercy given by which we are freed, and the grace provided for our time of need."
218,"Ah, Holy Jesus","1 Ah, holy Jesus, how hast thou offended, that we to judge thee have in hate pretended? By foes derided, by thine own rejected, O most afflicted! 2 Who was the guilty? Who brought this upon thee? Alas, my treason, Jesus, hath undone thee. ’Twas I, Lord Jesus, I it was denied thee; I crucified thee. 3 Lo, the Good Shepherd for the sheep is offered; the slave hath sinned, and the Son hath suffered; for our atonement, while we nothing heeded, God interceded. 4 For me, kind Jesus, was thine incarnation, thy mortal sorrow, and thy life’s oblation, thy death of anguish and thy bitter passion, for my salvation. 5 Therefore, kind Jesus, since I cannot pay thee, I do adore thee, and will ever pray thee, think on thy pity and thy love unswerving, not my deserving."
219,They Crucified My Lord,"1 They crucified my Lord, and he never said a mumbalin’ word; they crucified my Lord, and he never said a mumbalin’ word. Not a word, not a word, not a word. 2 They nailed him to a tree, and he never said a mumbalin’ word; they nailed him to a tree, and he never said a mumbalin’ word. Not a word, not a word, not a word. 3 They pierced him in the side, and he never said a mumbalin’ word; they pierced him in the side, and he never said a mumbalin’ word. Not a word, not a word, not a word. 4 The blood came trickalin’ down, and he never said a mumbalin’ word; the blood came trickalin’ down, and he never said a mumbalin’ word. Not a word, not a word, not a word. 5 He bowed his head and died, and he never said a mumbalin’ word; he bowed his head and died, and he never said a mumbalin’ word. Not a word, not a word, not a word."
220,Go to Dark Gethsemane,"1 Go to dark Gethsemane, all who feel the tempter’s power; your Redeemer’s conflict see; watch with him one bitter hour; turn not from his griefs away; learn from Jesus Christ to pray. 2 Follow to the judgment hall; view the Lord of life arraigned; O the wormwood and the gall! O the pangs his soul sustained! Shun not suffering, shame, or loss; learn from him to bear the cross. 3 Calvary’s mournful mountain climb; there, adoring at his feet, mark that miracle of time, God’s own sacrifice complete; “It is finished!” hear him cry; learn from Jesus Christ to die. 4 Early hasten to the tomb where they laid his breathless clay: all is solitude and gloom. Who has taken him away? Christ is risen! He meets our eyes. Savior, teach us so to rise."
221,"O Sacred Head, Now Wounded","1 O sacred head, now wounded, with grief and shame weighed down; now scornfully surrounded with thorns, thine only crown; O sacred head, what glory, what bliss till now was thine! Yet, though despised and gory, I joy to call thee mine. 2 What thou, my Lord, hast suffered was all for sinners’ gain: mine, mine was the transgression, but thine the deadly pain. Lo, here I fall, my Savior! ’Tis I deserve thy place; look on me with thy favor, and grant to me thy grace. 3 What language shall I borrow to thank thee, dearest friend, for this thy dying sorrow, thy pity without end? O make me thine forever; and should I fainting be, Lord, let me never, never outlive my love to thee."
222,Rejected and Despised,"1 Rejected and despised by men and women of our race, he bears transgression’s wounding weight and anguish mars his face. This Man of Sorrows, born to loss, acquainted with our grief: this Christ of God now crucified astonishes belief. 2 In all the victims of our age, the battered and the bruised, Christ lives again, alike with them by human sin abused: ascending on a cross to die, descending into hell; in torment, suffering, scorn, and pain, we meet our God as well. 3 Forgive us, Lord, as you forgave with your expiring breath the ones whose guilty hands, like ours, required a guiltless death. O mystery of such costly love, O depth of grace revealed: in scourge-marked flesh, we find our Christ, and by his stripes are healed."
223,When I Survey the Wondrous Cross,"1 When I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of glory died, my richest gain I count but loss, and pour contempt on all my pride. 2 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast, save in the death of Christ my God; all the vain things that charm me most, I sacrifice them to his blood. 3 See, from his head, his hands, his feet, sorrow and love flow mingled down; did e’er such love and sorrow meet, or thorns compose so rich a crown? 4 Were the whole realm of nature mine, that were a present far too small; love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all."
224,When I Survey the Wondrous Cross,"1 When I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of glory died, my richest gain I count but loss, and pour contempt on all my pride. 2 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast, save in the death of Christ my God; all the vain things that charm me most, I sacrifice them to his blood. 3 See, from his head, his hands, his feet, sorrow and love flow mingled down; did e’er such love and sorrow meet, or thorns compose so rich a crown? 4 Were the whole realm of nature mine, that were a present far too small; love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all."
225,"Sing, My Tongue, the Glorious Battle","1 Sing, my tongue, the glorious battle; tell the triumph far and wide; tell aloud the wondrous story of the cross, the Crucified; tell how Christ, the world's redeemer, vanquished death the day he died. 2 God in mercy saw us fallen, sunk in shame and misery, felled to death in Eden's garden, where in pride we claimed the tree; then another tree was chosen, which the world from death would free. 3 Tell how, when at length the fullness of the_appointed time was come, Christ, the Word, was born of woman, left for us the heavenly home, blazed the path of true obedience, shone as light amidst the gloom. 4 Thirty years among us dwelling, Jesus went from Nazareth, destined, dedicated, willing, did his work and met his death; like a lamb he humbly yielded on the cross his dying breath. 5 Faithful cross, true sign of triumph, be for all the noblest tree; none in foliage, none in blossom, none in fruit your equal be; symbol of the world's redemption, for your burden makes us free."
226,There in God's Garden,"1 There in God’s garden stands the tree of Wisdom, whose leaves hold forth the healing of the nations: tree of all knowledge, tree of all compassion, tree of all beauty. 2 Its name is Jesus, name that says, “Our Savior!” There on its branches see the scars of suffering; see there the tendrils of our human selfhood feed on its lifeblood. 3 Thorns not its own are tangled in its foliage; our greed has starved it; our despite has choked it. Yet, look! it lives! its grief has not destroyed it nor fire consumed it. 4 See how its branches reach to us in welcome; hear what the Voice says, “Come to me, ye weary! Give me your sickness; give me all your sorrow; I will give blessing.” 5 This is my ending; this, my resurrection; into your hands, Lord, I commit my spirit. This have I searched for; now I can possess it. This ground is holy. 6 All heaven is singing, “Thanks to Christ whose passion offers in mercy healing, strength, and pardon. Peoples and nations, take it; take it freely!” Amen!  My Master!"
227,"Jesus, Remember Me","Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom. Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."
228,Were You There,"1 Were you there when they crucified my Lord? (Were you there?) Were you there when they crucified my Lord? O! Sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble. Were you there when they crucified my Lord? (Were you there?) 2 Were you there when they nailed him to the tree? (Were you there?) Were you there when they nailed him to the tree? O! Sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble. Were you there when they nailed him to the tree? (Were you there?) 3 Were you there when they pierced him in the side? (Were you there?) Were you there when they pierced him in the side? O! Sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble. Were you there when they pierced him in the side? (Were you there?) 4 Were you there when the sun refused to shine? (Were you there?) Were you there when the sun refused to shine? O! Sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble. Were you there when the sun refused to shine? (Were you there?) 5 Were you there when they laid him in the tomb? (Were you there?) Were you there when they laid him in the tomb? O! Sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble. Were you there when they laid him in the tomb? (Were you there?) Opt. 6 Were you there when he rose up from the dead?"
229,In the Darkness of the Morning,"1 In the darkness of the morning, just before the hint of dawn, Mary Magdalene discovered Jesus Christ, her friend, was gone. 2 Days before, she faced his suffering; she stayed with him as he died. Seeing now his tomb was empty, she remained outside and cried. 3 As she wept, the warmth of sunrise filled the waiting world with light. Then she turned and saw a stranger, though her tears obscured her sight. 4 Asked the man, “Why are you weeping?” in a voice she vaguely knew. “He is gone, and I must find him,” she replied as morning grew. 5 “Mary!” said the smiling stranger as her vision was restored. She cried “Teacher!” and she touched him: Jesus Christ, her risen Lord."
230,Joyful Is the Dark,"1 Joyful is the dark, holy, hidden God, rolling cloud of night beyond all naming: majesty in darkness, energy of love, Word-in-flesh, the mystery proclaiming. 2 Joyful is the dark Spirit of the deep, winging wildly o'er the world's creation, silken sheen of midnight plumage black and bright, swooping with the beauty of a raven. 3 Joyful is the dark, shadowed stable floor; angels flicker, God on earth confessing, as with exultation, Mary, giving birth, hails the infant cry of need and blessing. 4 Joyful is the dark coolness of the tomb, waiting for the wonder of the morning; never was that midnight touched by dread and gloom: darkness was the cradle of the dawning. 5 Joyful is the dark depth of love divine, roaring, looming thundercloud of glory, holy, haunting beauty, living, loving God. Hallelujah! Sing and tell the story!"
231,Christ Has Risen While Earth Slumbers,"1 Christ has risen while earth slumbers; Christ has risen where hope died, as he said and as he promised, as we doubted and denied. Let the moon embrace the blessing; let the sun sustain the cheer; let the world confirm the rumor: Christ is risen, God is here! 2 Christ has risen for the people whom he died to love and save; Christ has risen for the women bringing flowers to grace his grave. Christ has risen for disciples huddled in an upstairs room. He whose word inspired creation can’t be silenced by the tomb. 3 Christ has risen and for ever lives to challenge and to change all whose lives are messed or mangled, all who find religion strange. Christ is risen, Christ is present making us what he has been: evidence of transformation in which God is known and seen."
232,Jesus Christ Is Risen Today,"1 Jesus Christ is risen today, Alleluia! our triumphant holy day, Alleluia! who did once upon the cross, Alleluia! suffer to redeem our loss. Alleluia! 2 Hymns of praise then let us sing, Alleluia! unto Christ, our heavenly King, Alleluia! who endured the cross and grave, Alleluia! sinners to redeem and save. Alleluia! 3 But the pains which he endured, Alleluia! our salvation have procured. Alleluia! Now above the sky he's King, Alleluia! where the angels ever sing. Alleluia! 4 Sing we to our God above, Alleluia! praise eternal as God's love. Alleluia! Praise our God, ye heavenly host, Alleluia! Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Alleluia!"
233,The Day of Resurrection!,"1 The day of resurrection! Earth, tell it out abroad, the Passover of gladness, the Passover of God. From death to life eternal, from sin’s dominion free, our Christ has brought us over with hymns of victory. 2 Let hearts be purged of evil that we may see aright the Lord in rays eternal of resurrection light, and listening to his accents, may hear, so calm and plain, his own “All hail!” and hearing, may raise the victor strain. 3 Now let the heavens be joyful; let earth its song begin; the round world keep high triumph and all that is therein. Let all things seen and unseen their notes of gladness blend, for Christ the Lord has risen, our joy that has no end."
234,"Come, You Faithful, Raise the Strain","1 Come, you faithful, raise the strain of triumphant gladness! God has brought forth Israel into joy from sadness, loosed from Pharaoh’s bitter yoke Jacob’s sons and daughters; led them with unmoistened foot through the Red Sea waters. 2 ’Tis the spring of souls today: Christ has burst his prison, and from three days’ sleep in death as a sun has risen. All the winter of our sins, long and dark, is flying from the Light, to whom we give laud and praise undying. 3 Now the queen of seasons, bright with the day of splendor, with the royal feast of feasts comes its joy to render; comes to glad Jerusalem, who with true affection welcomes in unwearied strains Jesus’ resurrection! 4 Neither could the gates of death, nor the tomb’s dark portal, nor the watchers, nor the seal hold you as a mortal: but today, among your own, you appear, bestowing your deep peace, which evermore passes human knowing."
235,"O Sons and Daughters, Let Us Sing","Refrain: Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! 1 O sons and daughters, let us sing with heavenly hosts to Christ our King; today the grave has lost its sting! Alleluia! Alleluia! 2 That night the_apostles met in fear; among them came their Lord most dear, and said, “My peace be with you here.” Alleluia! Alleluia! 3 When Thomas first the tidings heard, how they had seen the risen Lord, he doubted the disciples’ word. Alleluia! Alleluia! 4 ""My pierced side, O Thomas, see; and look upon my hands, my feet; not faithless, but believing be."" Alleluia! Alleluia! 5 No longer Thomas then denied; he saw the feet, the hands, the side; ""You are my Lord and God!"" he cried. Alleluia! Alleluia! 6 How blest are they who have not seen, and yet whose faith has constant been, for they eternal life shall win. Alleluia! Alleluia!"
236,The Strife Is O'er,"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia! 1 The strife is o'er, the battle done; the victory of life is won; the song of triumph has begun. Alleluia! 2 The powers of death have done their worst, but Christ their legions hath dispersed: let shouts of holy joy outburst. Alleluia! 3 The three sad days are quickly sped; Christ rises glorious from the dead: all glory to our risen Head! Alleluia! 4 Lord, by the stripes which wounded thee, from death’s dread sting thy servants free, that we may live, and sing to thee: Alleluia!"
237,Christ Jesus Lay in Death's Strong Bands,"1 Christ Jesus lay in death’s strong bands for our offenses given; but now at God’s right hand Christ stands and brings us light from heaven; therefore let us joyful be and sing to God right thankfully loud songs of hallelujah! Hallelujah! 2 Our Savior Jesus, God’s own Son, here in our stead descended; the knot of sin has been undone; the reign of death is ended. Christ has crushed the power of hell; now death is but an empty shell. Its sting is lost forever! Hallelujah! 3 Here the true Paschal Lamb we see, whom God so freely gave us. He died on the accursed tree so strong his love to save us. See, his blood now marks our door: faith points to it; death passes o'er, and Satan cannot harm us. Hallelujah! 4 So let us keep the festival where-to the Lord invites us; Christ is the very joy of all, the sun that warms and lights us. Now his grace to us imparts eternal sunshine to our hearts; the night of sin is ended! Hallelujah!"
238,Thine Is the Glory,"1 Thine is the glory, risen, conquering Son; endless is the victory thou o'er death hast won. Angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away, kept the folded grave-clothes where thy body lay. Refrain: Thine is the glory, risen, conquering Son; endless is the victory thou o'er death hast won. 2 Lo! Jesus meets us, risen from the tomb; lovingly he greets us, scatters fear and gloom. Let the church with gladness hymns of triumph sing, for the Lord now liveth; death hath lost its sting.	(Refrain) 3 No more we doubt thee, glorious Prince of life! Life is naught without thee; aid us in our strife. Make us more than conquerors through thy deathless love; bring us safe through Jordan to thy home above.	(Refrain)"
239,"Good Christians All, Rejoice and Sing!","1 Good Christians all, rejoice and sing! Now is the triumph of our King! To all the world glad news we bring: Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! 2 The Lord of life is risen today! Death’s mighty stone is rolled away. Let all the earth rejoice and say: Alleluia! Alleluia!

241,"Woman, Weeping in the Garden","1 Woman, weeping in the garden, who has pushed the stone aside? Who has taken Jesus’ body, Jesus Christ the crucified? 2 Woman, waiting in the garden, after men have come and gone, after angels give their witness, silently you watch the dawn. 3 Woman, walking in the garden, Jesus takes you by surprise; when the gardener calls you, “Mary!” faith and joy meet in your eyes. 4 Woman, weeping in the garden, weep for joy, for you have seen Jesus, the Messiah, risen; Christ, of whom the prophets dream. 5 Woman, dancing from the garden, find the others and proclaim Christ is risen as he promised; tell the world he knew your name!"
242,Day of Delight and Beauty Unbounded,"Day of Delight and Beauty Unbounded Refrain: Day of delight and beauty unbounded, tell the news, the gospel spread! Day of all wonder, day of all splendor, praise Christ risen from the dead! 1 Sing of the sun from darkness appearing; sing of the seed from barren earth greening; sing of creation, alleluia!

No longer bound to distant years in Palestine, but saving, healing, here and now, and touching every place and time. 3 In every insult, rift, and war where color, scorn, or wealth divide, Christ suffers still, yet loves the more, and lives, where even hope has died. 4 Women and men, in age and youth, can feel the Spirit, hear the call, and find the way, the life, the truth, revealed in Jesus, freed for all. 5 Christ is alive, and comes to bring good news to this and every age, till earth and sky and ocean ring with joy, with justice, love, and praise."
247,Now the Green Blade Rises,"1 Now the green blade rises from the buried grain, wheat that in dark earth many days has lain; love lives again, that with the dead has been; love is come again like wheat arising green. 2 In the grave they laid him, love by hatred slain, thinking that he would never wake again, laid in the earth like grain that sleeps unseen; love is come again like wheat arising green. 3 Forth he came at Easter like the risen grain, he that for three days in the grave had lain; raised from the dead, my living Lord is seen; love is come again like wheat arising green. 4 When our hearts are wintry, grieving, or in pain, your touch can call us back to life again; fields of our hearts that dead and bare have been: love is come again like wheat arising green."
248,Christ Is Risen! Shout Hosanna!,"1 Christ is risen! Shout Hosanna! Celebrate this day of days! Christ is risen! Hush in wonder: all creation is amazed. In the desert all-surrounding, see, a spreading tree has grown. Healing leaves of grace abounding bring a taste of love unknown. 2 Christ is risen! Raise your spirits from the caverns of despair. Walk with gladness in the morning. See what love can do and dare. Drink the wine of resurrection, not a servant, but a friend. Jesus is our strong companion. Joy and peace shall never end. 3 Christ is risen! Earth and heaven nevermore shall be the same. Break the bread of new creation where the world is still in pain. Tell its grim, demonic chorus: ""Christ is risen! Get you gone!""' God the First and Last is with us. Sing Hosanna everyone!"

In the cold and snow of winter there’s a spring that waits to be, unrevealed until its season, something God alone can see. 2 There’s a song in every silence, seeking word and melody; there’s a dawn in every darkness, bringing hope to you and me. From the past will come the future; what it holds, a mystery, unrevealed until its season, something God alone can see. 3 In our end is our beginning; in our time, infinity; in our doubt there is believing; in our life, eternity. In our death, a resurrection; at the last, a victory, unrevealed until its season, something God alone can see."

252,Day of Arising,"1 Day of arising, Christ on the roadway, unknown companion walks with his own. When they invite him, as fades the first day, and bread is broken, Christ is made known. 2 When we are walking, doubtful and dreading, blinded by sadness, slowness of heart, yet Christ walks with us, ever awaiting our invitation: Stay, do not part. 3 Lo, I am with you, Jesus has spoken. This is Christ's promise, this is Christ's sign: when the church gathers, when bread is broken, there Christ is with us, in bread and wine. 4 Christ, our companion, hope for the journey, bread of compassion, open our eyes. Grant us your vision, set all hearts burning that all creation with you may rise."
253,Alleluia! Christ Is Arisen,"Refrain: Alleluia! Christ is arisen. Bright is the dawning of the Lord's day. 1 Run, faithful women, to the graveside. Marvel, the stone is rolled away!

Christ comes again, and every Lord's day: ""Touch me and see; have faith in me."" 	(Refrain) Estribillo: ¡Aleluya! Cristo resucitó la madrugada del domingo. 1 Fueron mujeres al sepulcro. La piedra un ángel removió; les dijo: ""Ha resucitado"". Y al irse, les salió el Señor.	Estribillo 2 La Magdalena fue a llorarlo y Cristo se le apareció; le pidió ir a sus hermanos con un encargo que le dio. 	Estribillo 3 A los discípulos, de tarde, Cristo también se presentó. Les enseño las cinco heridas; dando la paz los saludó. 	Estribillo 4 Tomás no estaba en ese encuentro; y ver, pidió, para creer. Cristo volvió, le dijo: ""Mira, palpa mi herida y ten fe"". 	Estribillo"
254,That Easter Day with Joy Was Bright,"1 That Easter day with joy was bright; the sun shone out with fairer light when, to their longing eyes restored, the apostles saw their risen Lord. 2 He bade them see his hands, his side, where yet the glorious wounds abide, the tokens true which made it plain their Lord indeed was risen again. 3 From every weapon death can wield, your own redeemed forever shield; O Lord of all, with us abide in this our joyful Eastertide."
255,"O Sons and Daughters, Let Us Sing","Refrain: Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! 1 O sons and daughters, let us sing with heavenly hosts to Christ our King; today the grave has lost its sting! Alleluia! Alleluia! 2 That night the apostles met in fear; among them came their Lord most dear, and said, “My peace be with you here.” Alleluia! Alleluia! 3 When Thomas first the tidings heard, how they had seen the risen Lord, he doubted the disciples’ word. Alleluia!

Alleluia! 6 How blest are they who have not seen, and yet whose faith has constant been, for they eternal life shall win. Alleluia! Alleluia!"
256,These Things Did Thomas Count as Real,"These Things Did Thomas Count as Real 1 These things did Thomas count as real: the warmth of blood, the chill of steel, the grain of wood, the heft of stone, the last frail twitch of blood and bone. 2 The vision of his skeptic mind was keen enough to make him blind to any unexpected act too large for his small world of fact. 3 His reasoned certainties denied that one could live when one had died, until his fingers read like Braille the markings of the spear and nail. 4 May we, O God, by grace believe and thus the risen Christ receive, whose raw imprinted hands reached out and beckoned Thomas from his doubt."
257,The Risen Christ,"1 The risen Christ, who walks on wounded feet from garden tomb through darkened city street, unlocks the door of grief, despair, and fear, and speaks a word of peace to all who hear. 2 The risen Christ, who stands with wounded side, breathes out his Spirit on them to abide whose faith still wavers, who dare not believe; new grace, new strength, new purpose they receive. 3 The risen Christ, who breaks with wounded hand the bread for those who fail to understand, reveals himself, despite their lingering tears, enflames their hearts, then quickly disappears. 4 May we, Christ's body, walk and serve and stand with the oppressed in this and every land, till all are blessed and can a blessing be, restored in Christ to true humanity."
258,A Hymn of Glory Let Us Sing!,"1 A hymn of glory let us sing! New songs throughout the world shall ring: Christ, by a road before untrod, ascends unto the throne of God. 2 The holy apostolic band upon the Mount of Olives stand, and with his followers they see their Lord ascend in majesty. 3 To all, the shining angels cry, ""Why stand and gaze upon the sky? This is the Savior!"" thus they say; ""this is his glorious triumph-day."" 4 ""You see him now, ascending high up to the portals of the sky. Hereafter you shall Jesus see returning in great majesty."" 5 O risen Christ, ascended Lord, all praise to you let earth accord. You are, while endless ages run, with Father and with Spirit one."
259,The God of Heaven,"1 The God of heaven thunders, whose voice in strident echoes resounds above the waters, and all the world sings, ""Glory, glory, glory!"" 2 The desert writhes in tempest; wind whips the trees to fury; the lightning splits the forest and flame diffuses glory, glory, glory! 3 The mighty God eternal is to the throne ascended, and we who are God's people, within these walls cry, ""Glory, glory, glory!"""
260,Alleluia! Sing to Jesus,"1 Alleluia! Sing to Jesus; his the scepter, his the throne; Alleluia! his the triumph, his the victory alone! Hark! The songs of peaceful Zion thunder like a mighty flood: ""Jesus out of every nation has redeemed us by his blood."" 2 Alleluia! Not as orphans are we left in sorrow now; Alleluia! he is near us; faith believes nor questions how. Though the cloud from sight received him, when the forty days were o'er, shall our hearts forget his promise: ""I am with you evermore""? 3 Alleluia! Bread of angels, here on earth our food, our stay; Alleluia! here the sinful flee to you from day to day.

King eternal, Lord omnipotent we own; Alleluia! born of Mary, earth your footstool, heaven your throne.

264,At the Name of Jesus,"1 At the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, every tongue confess him King of glory now; 'tis the Father's pleasure we should call him Lord, who from the beginning was the mighty Word. 2 Humbled for a season to receive a name from the lips of sinners unto whom he came, faithfully he bore it spotless to the last, brought it back victorious, when from death he passed; 3 Bore it up triumphant, with its human light, through all ranks of creatures, to the central height, to the throne of Godhead, to the Father's breast, filled it with the glory of that perfect rest. 4 Christians, this Lord Jesus shall return again, with his Father's glory o'er the earth to reign; for all wreaths of empire meet upon his brow, and our hearts confess him King of glory now."
265,Jesus Shall Reign Where'er the Sun,"1 Jesus shall reign where'er the sun does its successive journeys run; his kingdom stretch from shore to shore, till moons shall wax and wane no more. 2 To him shall endless prayer be made, and praises throng to crown his head; his name, like sweet perfume, shall rise with every morning sacrifice. 3 People and realms of every tongue dwell on his love with sweetest song, and infant voices shall proclaim their early blessings on his name. 4 Blessings abound where'er he reigns: the prisoners leap to loose their chains; the weary find eternal rest, and all who suffer want are blest. 5 Let every creature rise and bring honors peculiar to our King; angels descend with songs again, and earth repeat the loud Amen!"

On heaven's blissful shore his goodness we'll adore, singing forevermore: Alleluia! Amen!"
268,Crown Him with Many Crowns,"1 Crown him with many crowns, the Lamb upon his throne; hark, how the heavenly anthem drowns all music but its own! Awake, my soul, and sing of him who died for thee, and hail him as thy matchless King through all eternity. 2 Crown him the Lord of love; behold his hands and side, rich wounds, yet visible above, in beauty glorified: no angel in the sky can fully bear that sight, but downward bends his burning eye at mysteries so bright. 3 Crown him the Lord of peace, whose power a scepter sways from pole to pole, that wars may cease, absorbed in prayer and praise. His reign shall know no end; and round his pierced feet fair flowers of paradise extend their fragrance ever sweet. 4 Crown him the Lord of years, the potentate of time; creator of the rolling spheres, ineffably sublime. All hail, Redeemer, hail! For thou hast died for me; thy praise shall never, never fail throughout eternity."
269,"Lead On, O King Eternal!","1 Lead on, O King eternal! The day of march has come; henceforth in fields of conquest your tents shall be our home. Through days of preparation your grace has made us strong, and now, O King eternal, we lift our battle song. 2 Lead on, O King eternal, till sin's fierce war shall cease, and holiness shall whisper the sweet amen of peace; for not with swords' loud clashing, nor roll of stirring drums; with deeds of love and mercy the heavenly kingdom comes. 3 Lead on, O King eternal: we follow, not with fears, for gladness breaks like morning where'er your face appears; your cross is lifted o'er us; we journey in its light. The crown awaits the conquest; lead on, O God of might!"
270,"O Lord, You Are My God and King","1 O Lord, you are my God and King, and I will ever bless your name; I will extol you every day, and evermore your praise proclaim. You, Lord, are greatly to be praised; your greatness is beyond our thought; all generations shall tell forth the mighty wonders you have wrought. 2 How rich in grace are you, O Lord, full of compassion, merciful, your anger always slow to rise; your steadfast love you show to all, for you are good in all your ways; your creatures know your constant care. To all your works your love extends; all souls your tender mercies share. 3 Your works will give you thanks, O Lord; your saints your mighty acts will show, till all the peoples of the earth your kingdom, power, glory know. Eternal is your kingdom, Lord, forever strong, forever sure; while generations rise and die, your high dominion will endure."
271,The Lord Almighty Reigns,"1 The Lord Almighty reigns in majesty most bright, appareled in omnipotence, and girded round with might. 2 The world established stands on its foundations broad; your throne is fixed, you reign supreme, the everlasting God. 3 The seas have lifted up their voice in majesty, but God on high, supreme in might, is greater than the sea. 4 Your testimonies, Lord, in faithfulness excel, and holy must your servants be who in your temple dwell."

274,"You, Lord, Are Both Lamb and Shepherd","1 You, Lord, are both Lamb and Shepherd. You, Lord, are both prince and slave. You, peace-maker and sword-bringer of the way you took and gave. You, the everlasting instant; you, whom we both scorn and crave. 2 Clothed in light upon the mountain, stripped of might upon the cross, shining in eternal glory, beggared by a soldier’s toss, you, the everlasting instant; you who are both gift and cost. 3 You, who walk each day beside us, sit in power at God’s side. You, who preach a way that’s narrow, have a love that reaches wide. You, the everlasting instant; you, who are our pilgrim guide. 4 Worthy is our earthly Jesus! Worthy is our cosmic Christ! Worthy your defeat and victory; worthy still your peace and strife. You, the everlasting instant; you, who are our death and life."
275,A Mighty Fortress Is Our God,"1 A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing. Our helper he, amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing. For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe. His craft and power are great, and armed with cruel hate, on earth is not his equal. 2 Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing, were not the right man on our side, the man of God's own choosing. Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is he. Lord Sabaoth his name, from age to age the same, and he must win the battle. 3 And though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us, we will not fear, for God hath willed his truth to triumph through us. The Prince of Darkness grim, we tremble not for him. His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure. One little word shall fell him. 4 That word above all earthly powers, no thanks to them, abideth. The Spirit and the gifts are ours through him who with us sideth. Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also. The body they may kill; God's truth abideth still. His kingdom is forever."

Amen."
279,"Come, Holy Spirit, Heavenly Dove","1 Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove, with all thy quickening powers; kindle a flame of sacred love in these cold hearts of ours. 2 In vain we tune our formal songs; in vain we strive to rise; hosannas languish on our tongues, and our devotion dies. 3 Dear Lord, and shall we ever live at this poor dying rate? Our love so faint, so cold to thee, and thine to us so great! 4 Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove, with all thy quickening powers; come, shed abroad a Savior's love, and that shall kindle ours."

For none can guess God’s grace, till Love creates a place wherein the Holy Spirit makes a dwelling."

A mighty wind came blowing, filled all the swirling air, and tongues of fire aglowing inspired each person there. 2 The people all around them were startled and amazed to understand their language, as Christ the Lord they praised. What universal message, what great good news was here? That Christ, once dead, is risen to vanquish all our fear. 3 God pours the Holy Spirit on all who would believe, on women, men, and children who would God's grace receive. That Spirit knows no limit, bestowing life and power.

In deep, flowing waters, we share in Christ’s death, then, rising to new life, give thanks with each breath. 2 In Christ called to banquet, one table we share, a haven of welcome, a circle of care. Although we are many, we share in one bread.

By grace may our living give proof to our praise in costly compassion reflecting Christ’s ways. 4 Unite us, anoint us, O Spirit of love, for you are within us, around us, above.

May your care and mercy lead us to a just society: with the Spirit’s gifts empower us for the work of ministry. 5 Lord, you bless with words assuring: “I am with you to the end.” Faith and hope and love restoring, may we serve as you intend, and, amid the cares that claim us, hold in mind eternity: with the Spirit’s gifts empower us for the work of ministry."

302,When Hands Reach Out and Fingers Trace,"1 When hands reach out and fingers trace the beauty of a loved one's face, we thank you, God, that love relies on gifts of grace not seen with eyes. 2 When fingers spell and signs express our prayer and praise and thankfulness, we thank you, God, that hands can sing; you bless the silent songs we bring. 3 When broken bodies will not mend, we thank you, God, for Christ our friend. In him, our healing can begin: he welcomes all the wounded in. 4 And when the ways we learn and grow are not the ways that others know, we thank you, God, that we have learned your love's a gift, and never earned. 5 Your Spirit gives us differing ways to serve you well and offer praise. When all are joined as one, we'll be your able, strong community."
303,"God the Spirit, Guide and Guardian","1 God the Spirit, guide and guardian, wind-sped flame and hovering dove, breath of life and voice of prophets, sign of blessing, power of love: give to those who lead your people fresh anointing of your grace; send them forth as bold apostles to your church in every place. 2 Christ our Savior, sovereign, shepherd, Word made flesh, Love crucified, teacher, healer, suffering servant, friend of sinners, foe of pride: in your tending may all *pastors learn and live a shepherd's care; grant them courage and compassion shown through word and deed and prayer. 3 Great Creator, life-bestower, truth beyond all thought's recall, fount of wisdom, womb of mercy, giving and forgiving all: as you know our strength and weakness, so may those the church exalts oversee its life steadfastly, yet not overlook its faults. 4 Triune God, mysterious being, undivided and diverse, deeper than our minds can fathom, greater than our creeds rehearse: help us in our varied callings your full image to proclaim, that our ministries uniting may give glory to your name. *Or ""elders"" or ""deacons"""
304,O Sing a New Song to the Lord,"1 O sing a new song to the Lord; sing, all the earth and bless that Name; from day to day God's praise record; the Lord's redeeming grace proclaim. 2 Tell all the world God's wondrous ways; tell all the nations far and near: great is the Lord, and great God's praise; the Lord alone, let nations fear. 3 The nations’ gods are idols vain; the shining heavens the Lord supports; both light and honor lead the train, while strength and beauty fill the courts. 4 Let every tongue and every tribe give to the Lord due praise and sing; all glory unto God ascribe; come, throng God’s courts, and offerings bring. 5 Let heaven be glad, let earth rejoice; the teeming sea resound with praise; let waving fields lift high their voice, and all the trees their anthem raise. Alleluia!"
305,"Come Sing, O Church, in Joy!","1 Come sing, O church, in joy! Come join, O church, in song! For Christ the Lord has led us through the ages long! Refrain: In bold accord, come celebrate the journey now and praise the Lord! 2 Long years have come and gone, and still God reigns supreme, empowering us to catch the vision, dream the dream!	(Refrain) 3 Let courage be our friend; let wisdom be our guide, as we in mission magnify the Crucified! 	(Refrain) 4 Come sing, O church, in joy! Come join, O church, in song! For Christ the Lord has triumphed o'er the ages long! 	(Refrain)"
306,Blest Be the Tie That Binds,"1 Blest be the tie that binds our hearts in Christian love. The fellowship of kindred minds is like to that above. 2 Before our *Father's throne we pour our ardent prayers. Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one, our comforts and our cares. 3 We share our mutual woes; our mutual burdens bear. And often for each other flows the sympathizing tear. 4 When we are called to part, it gives us inward pain; but we shall still be joined in heart, and hope to meet again. 5 From sorrow, toil, and pain, and sin we shall be free; and perfect love and friendship reign through all eternity. *Or “Maker’s”"
307,God of Grace and God of Glory,"1 God of grace and God of glory, on thy people pour thy power; crown thine ancient church's story; bring its bud to glorious flower. Grant us wisdom, grant us courage, for the facing of this hour, for the facing of this hour. 2 Lo! the hosts of evil round us scorn thy Christ, assail his ways! From the fears that long have bound us free our hearts to faith and praise. Grant us wisdom, grant us courage, for the living of these days, for the living of these days. 3 Cure thy children's warring madness; bend our pride to thy control; shame our wanton, selfish gladness, rich in things and poor in soul. Grant us wisdom, grant us courage, lest we miss thy kingdom's goal, lest we miss thy kingdom's goal. 4 Save us from weak resignation to the evils we deplore. Let the gift of thy salvation be our glory evermore. Grant us wisdom, grant us courage, serving thee whom we adore, serving thee whom we adore."
308,O God in Whom All Life Begins,"1 O God in whom all life begins, who births the seed to fruit, bestow your blessing on our lives; here let your love find root. Bring forth in us the Spirit’s gifts of patience, joy, and peace; deliver us from numbing fear, and grant our faith increase. 2 Unite in mutual ministry our minds and hands and hearts that we may have the grace to seek the power your peace imparts. So let our varied gifts combine to glorify your Name that in all things by word and deed we may your love proclaim. 3 Through tears and laughter, grief and joy, enlarge our trust and care; so bind us in community that we may risk and dare. Be with us when we gather here to worship, sing, and pray; then send us forth in power and faith to live the words we say."
309,"Come, Great God of All the Ages","1 Come, great God of all the ages; make your earthly mission known; speak through every deed and person; let your way and will be shown. Guide the church to true commitment; give direction now, we ask; fit us for the work of building; dedicate us to the task. 2 Come, Christ Jesus, flesh and spirit, sure foundation, cornerstone; help us form the church eternal; may your vision be our own. Send a message to each follower; lead all people to your way; urge us to strong faith and action as we build the church today. 3 Come, great Spirit, in and with us, tune our ears to hear your call; through the moving of your presence, let redeeming love recall ministry in dedication, love embodied in our deeds; challenge us to do your bidding, see your purpose, fill all needs. 4 Come, O come, in celebration, household of the one true God; in commitment and rejoicing let us go where Christ has trod; as we act in faith and reverence, let us, Lord, the future see; place us in the church triumphant, now and for eternity."
310,"I Love Thy Kingdom, Lord","1 I love thy kingdom, Lord, the house of thine abode, the church our blest Redeemer saved with his own precious blood. 2 I love thy church, O God. Her walls before thee stand, dear as the apple of thine eye, and graven on thy hand. 3 For her my tears shall fall; for her my prayers ascend; to her my cares and toils be given, till toils and cares shall end. 4 Beyond my highest joy I prize her heavenly ways: her sweet communion, solemn vows, her hymns of love and praise. 5 Sure as thy truth shall last, to Zion shall be given the brightest glories earth can yield, and brighter bliss of heaven."
311,"Here, O Lord, Your Servants Gather","1 Here, O Lord, your servants gather, hand we link with hand; looking toward our Savior's cross, joined in love we stand. As we seek the realm of God, we unite to pray: Jesus, Savior, guide our steps, for you are the Way. 2 Many are the tongues we speak, scattered are the lands; yet our hearts are one in God, one in love's demands. While in darkness hope appears, calling age and youth: Jesus, teacher, dwell with us, for you are the Truth. 3 Nature's secrets open wide, changes never cease; where, O where, can weary souls find the source of peace? Unto all those sore distressed, torn by endless strife: Jesus, healer, bring your balm, for you are the Life. 4 Grant, O God, an age renewed, filled with deathless love; help us as we work and pray; send us from above truth and courage, faith and power needed in our strife: Jesus, Savior, be our Way; be our Truth, our Life."
312,"Take Us as We Are, O God","1 Take us as we are, O God, and claim us as your own. As once you chose to tell your love in human flesh and bone, so let our lives be used to make your saving purpose known. 2 Bless us for your service, Lord; no power we devise will ever give us strength enough or make us truly wise, yet by your promise we can know the peace your grace supplies. 3 Break us open to disclose how brokenness can heal, wherever broken loaves suffice to give a crowd a meal and graves break open to release new life from death’s dread seal. 4 Give us to the world you love as light and salt and yeast, that we may nourish in your name the last, the lost, the least, until at length you call us all to your unending feast."
313,"Lord, Make Us More Holy","1 Lord, make us more holy; Lord, make us more holy; Lord, make us more holy, until we meet again: holy, holy, holy, until we meet again. 2 Lord, make us more loving; Lord, make us more loving; Lord, make us more loving, until we meet again: loving, loving, loving, until we meet again. 3 Lord, make us more patient; Lord, make us more patient; Lord, make us more patient, until we meet again: patient, patient, patient, until we meet again. 4 Lord, make us more faithful; Lord, make us more faithful; Lord, make us more faithful, until we meet again: faithful, faithful, faithful, until we meet again."
314,"Longing for Light, We Wait in Darkness","1 Longing for light, we wait in darkness. Longing for truth, we turn to you. Make us your own, your holy people, light for the world to see. Refrain: Christ, be our light! Shine in our hearts. Shine through the darkness. Christ, be our light! Shine in your church gathered today. 2 Longing for peace, our world is troubled. Longing for hope, many despair. Your word alone has power to save us. Make us your living voice. 	(Refrain) 3 Longing for food, many are hungry. Longing for water, many still thirst. Make us your bread, broken for others, shared until all are fed. 	(Refrain) 4 Longing for shelter, many are homeless. Longing for warmth, many are cold. Make us your building, sheltering others, walls made of living stone. 	(Refrain) 5 Many the gifts, many the people, many the hearts that yearn to belong. Let us be servants to one another, making your kingdom come. 	(Refrain)"
315,In the Midst of New Dimensions,"1 In the midst of new dimensions, in the face of changing ways, who will lead the pilgrim peoples wandering in their separate ways? (Refrain) God of rainbow, fiery pillar, leading where the eagles soar, we your people, ours the journey now and ever, now and ever, now and evermore. 2 Through the flood of starving people, warring factions, and despair, who will lift the olive branches? Who will light the flame of care?	(Refrain) 3 As we stand, a world divided by our own self-seeking schemes, grant that we, your global village, might envision wider dreams.	(Refrain) 4 We are man and we are woman, all persuasions, old and young, each a gift in your creation, each a love song to be sung.	(Refrain) 5 Should the threats of dire predictions cause us to withdraw in pain, may your blazing phoenix spirit resurrect the church again.	(Refrain)"
316,Where Charity and Love Prevail,"1 Where charity and love prevail, there God is ever found; brought here together by Christ’s love, by love we thus are bound. 2 Let us recall that in our midst dwells Christ, God’s holy Son. As members of each body joined, in him we are made one. 3 Let strife among us be unknown; let all contentions cease. Be God’s the glory that we seek; be his our only peace. 4 Let us forgive each other’s faults as we our own confess, that we may love each other well in Christian gentleness. 5 Love can exclude no race or creed if honored be God’s name; our common life embraces all whose Maker is the same."
317,In Christ There Is No East or West,"1 In Christ there is no east or west, in him no south or north, but one great fellowship of love throughout the whole wide earth. 2 In Christ shall true hearts everywhere their high communion find; his service is the golden cord close-binding humankind. 3 Join hands, disciples of the faith, whate'er your race may be. All children of the living God are surely kin to me. 4 In Christ now meet both east and west; in him meet south and north. All Christly souls are one in him throughout the whole wide earth."
318,In Christ There Is No East or West,"1 In Christ there is no east or west, in him no south or north, but one great fellowship of love throughout the whole wide earth. 2 In Christ shall true hearts everywhere their high communion find; his service is the golden cord close-binding humankind. 3 Join hands, disciples of the faith, whate'er your race may be. All children of the living God are surely kin to me. 4 In Christ now meet both east and west; in him meet south and north. All Christly souls are one in him throughout the whole wide earth."
319,"Men of Faith, Rise Up and Sing","1 Men of faith, rise up and sing of the great and glorious King. You are strong when you feel weak; in your brokenness, complete. 2 Rise up, women of the truth. Stand and sing to broken hearts who can know the healing power of our awesome King of love. 3 Rise up, church, with broken wings; fill this place with songs again of our God who reigns on high; by God’s grace again we’ll fly. Chorus: Shout to the north and the south; sing to the east and the west. Jesus is Savior to all, Lord of heaven and earth. Bridge: We’ve been through fire; we’ve been through rain; we’ve been refined by the power of your name. We’ve fallen deeper in love with you. You’ve burned this truth on our lips."
320,The Church of Christ in Every Age,"1 The church of Christ in every age, beset by change but Spirit-led, must claim and test its heritage and keep on rising from the dead. 2 Across the world, across the street, the victims of injustice cry for shelter and for bread to eat, and never live before they die. 3 Then let the servant church arise, a caring church that longs to be a partner in Christ's sacrifice, and clothed in Christ's humanity. 4 For Christ alone, whose blood was shed, can cure the fever in our blood, and teach us how to share our bread and feed the starving multitude. 5 We have no mission but to serve in full obedience to our Lord: to care for all, without reserve, and spread Christ's liberating word."
321,The Church's One Foundation,"1 The church's one foundation is Jesus Christ her Lord. She is his new creation by water and the word. From heaven he came and sought her to be his holy bride. With his own blood he bought her, and for her life he died. 2 Elect from every nation, yet one o'er all the earth, her charter of salvation: one Lord, one faith, one birth. One holy name she blesses, partakes one holy food, and to one hope she presses, with every grace endued. 3 Though with a scornful wonder this world sees her oppressed, by schisms rent asunder, by heresies distressed, yet saints their watch are keeping; their cry goes up: ""How long?"" And soon the night of weeping shall be the morn of song. 4 Mid toil and tribulation, and tumult of her war, she waits the consummation of peace forevermore: till with the vision glorious her longing eyes are blest, and the great church victorious shall be the church at rest. 5 Yet she on earth has union with God, the Three in One, and mystic sweet communion with those whose rest is won: O happy ones and holy! Lord, give us grace that we, like them, the meek and lowly, may live eternally."
322,We Are One in Christ Jesus,"We are one in Christ Jesus, all one body, all one spirit, all together. We share one God, one mighty Lord, one abiding faith, one binding love, one single baptism, one Holy Comforter, the Holy Spirit, uniting all. Somos uno en Cristo, somos uno, somos uno, uno solo. Un solo Dios, un solo Señor, una sola fe, un solo amor, un solo bautismo, un solo Espíritu, y ése es el Consolador."
323,Sound a Mystic Bamboo Song,"1 Sound a mystic bamboo song; raise a chanting lyric voice; beat the drum and play the flute; let the church of God rejoice. 2 See the Christ in tribal cloth, living in a squatter’s shed, bending as she plants the rice, sleeping on a pavement bed. 3 Free the Christ within the poor; break the chains of wealth and power. Let the age of sharing dawn; sing the promised gospel hour. 4 May your lively Spirit, God, blow throughout this ravished earth, giving cultures, creatures, plants, wholeness, stillness, growth, and worth."
324,For All the Faithful Women,"1 For all the faithful women who served in days of old, to you shall thanks be given; to all, their story told. They served with strength and gladness in tasks your wisdom gave. To you their lives bore witness, proclaimed your power to save. 2 We praise your name for Miriam, who sang triumphantly while Pharaoh’s vaunted army lay drowned beneath the sea; for Ruth, who left her homeland and ventured forth in faith, who pledged to serve and worship Naomi’s God till death. 3 We sing of busy Martha, who toiled with pot and pan while Mary sat in silence to hear the word again. We praise the other Mary, who hastened to the tomb and found her Lord arisen, dispelling doubt and gloom. 4 Lord, hear our praise of Dorcas, who served the sick and poor. Her hands were cups of kindness, her heart an open door. O God, for saints and servants, our fervent prayer we raise, that, faithful in your service, our lives may sing your praise."
325,By All Your Saints Still Striving,"1 By all your saints still striving, for all your saints at rest, your holy name, O Jesus, forevermore be blessed! For those passed on before us, we sing our praise anew and, walking in their footsteps, would live our lives for you. 2 We praise you for the Baptist, forerunner of the Word, our true Elijah, making a highway for the Lord. The last and greatest prophet, he saw the dawning ray of light that grows in splendor until the perfect day. 3 All praise, O Lord, for Andrew, the first to welcome you, whose witness to his brother named you Messiah true. May we, with hearts kept open to you throughout the year proclaim to friend and neighbor your advent ever near. 4  For Magdalene we praise you, steadfast at cross and tomb. Your “Mary!” in the garden dispelled her tears and gloom. Apostle to the apostles, she ran to spread the word. Send us to shout the good news that we have seen the Lord! 5 We pray for saints we know not, for saints still yet to be, for grace to bear true witness and serve you faithfully, till all the ransomed number who stand before the throne ascribe all power and glory and praise to God alone."
326,For All the Saints,"1 For all the saints who from their labors rest, who thee by faith before the world confessed, thy name, O Jesus, be forever blest. Alleluia! Alleluia! 2 Thou wast their rock, their fortress, and their might; thou, Lord, their captain in the well-fought fight; thou, in the darkness drear, their one true light. Alleluia! Alleluia! 3 O blest communion, fellowship divine! We feebly struggle; they in glory shine; yet all are one in thee, for all are thine. Alleluia! Alleluia! 4 And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long, steals on the ear the distant triumph song, and hearts are brave again, and arms are strong. Alleluia! Alleluia! 5 From earth's wide bounds, from ocean's farthest coast, through gates of pearl streams in the countless host, singing to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Alleluia! Alleluia!"
327,From All That Dwell Below the Skies,"1 From all that dwell below the skies let the Creator's praise arise: Alleluia! Alleluia! Let the Redeemer's name be sung through every land, in every tongue. Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! 2 In every land begin the song; to every land the strains belong: Alleluia! Alleluia! In cheerful sound all voices raise and fill the world with joyful praise. Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! 3 Eternal are thy mercies, Lord; eternal truth attends thy word: Alleluia! Alleluia! Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore, till suns shall rise and set no more. Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!"
328,"Praise God, All You Nations","Praise God, all you nations. People of God, sing praise! Praise God, all you nations. People of God, sing praise: God’s love is great and endures forever. Praise God, all you nations. People of God, sing praise! Da n’ase! Da n’ase! Da Onyame ase! Da n’ase! Da n’ase! Da Onyame ase! Efiase oye n’a n’adoe doe so. Da n’ase! Da n’ase! Da Onyame ase!"
329,God Is Our Refuge and Our Strength,"Psalm 46) 1 God is our refuge and our strength, our ever-present aid, and therefore, though the earth be moved, we will not be afraid; 2 Though hills amid the seas be cast, though foaming waters roar, yea, though the mighty billows shake the mountains on the shore. 3 Where God abides a river flows; that city will rejoice. But nations fear and kingdoms shake before God's thundering voice. 4 Since God is in the midst of it, the city walls shall stand, secure and safe with God's sure help, when trouble is at hand."
330,Our Help Is in the Name of God the Lord,"1 Our help is in the name of God the Lord, the One who made the heavens with a word, creator of the world, each living thing. Come, bless the Lord, lift up your hearts and sing: “Our help is in the name of God the Lord.” 2 When evil seems to have the upper hand, call on God’s name: the Lord, the great “I am.” When troubles rise and all around gives way, remember God stays with us night and day. Our help is in the name of God the Lord. 3 Praise God the Lord who hears the captives’ prayer. Like birds escaping from the fowler’s snare we are set free; our praises now ascend: “Blessed be the Lord: Creator, Savior, Friend. Our help is in the name of God the Lord.”"
331,"God of the Ages, Whose Almighty Hand","1 God of the ages, whose almighty hand leads forth in beauty all the starry band of shining worlds in splendor through the skies, our grateful songs before thy throne arise. 2 Thy love divine hath led us in the past. In this free land by thee our lot is cast. Be thou our ruler, guardian, guide, and stay: thy word our law, thy paths our chosen way. 3 From war's alarms, from deadly pestilence, be thy strong arm our ever sure defense. Thy true religion in our hearts increase. Thy bounteous goodness nourish us in peace. 4 Refresh thy people on their toilsome way. Lead us from night to never-ending day. Fill all our lives with love and grace divine, and glory, laud, and praise be ever thine."
332,The Right Hand of God,"1 The right hand of God is writing in our land, writing with power and with love; our conflicts and our fears, our triumphs and our tears, are recorded by the right hand of God. 2 The right hand of God is pointing in our land, pointing the way we must go; so clouded is the way, so easily we stray, but we’re guided by the right hand of God. 3 The right hand of God is striking in our land, striking out at envy, hate, and greed. Our selfishness and lust, our pride and deeds unjust, are destroyed by the right hand of God. 4 The right hand of God is healing in our land, healing broken bodies, minds, and souls; so wondrous is its touch with love that means so much, when we’re healed by the right hand of God. 5 The right hand of God is planting in our land, planting seeds of freedom, hope, and love; in these Caribbean lands, let people all join hands, and be one with the right hand of God."
333,How Our Hearts with Joy Abound,"1 How our hearts with joy abound, with your beauty all around; words are feeble to express your great love and righteousness. 2 Fairer still than human frame, ever to our eyes the same, steadfast love shines from your face; from your lips flow words of grace. 3 Yours the scepter, yours the throne; you to us are God alone. Vast the mercies to us given: wealth of earth, and joy of heaven."
334,With Grateful Heart My Thanks I Bring,"1 With grateful heart my thanks I bring; before the “gods” your praise I sing. I worship in your holy place and praise you for your truth and grace; for truth and grace together shine in your most holy Word divine. 2 I cried to you, and you did save; your word of grace new courage gave. The kings of earth shall thank you, Lord, for they have heard your wondrous word; yes, they shall come with songs of praise for great and glorious are your ways. 3 O Lord, enthroned in glory bright, you reign alone in heavenly height; the proud in vain your favor seek, but you have mercy for the meek. Through trouble though my pathway be, you will revive and strengthen me. 4 You will stretch forth your mighty arm to save me when my foes alarm. The work you have for me begun shall by your grace be fully done. Your love forever will endure: your mercy, Lord, is ever sure."
335,The Foolish in Their Hearts Deny,"1 The foolish in their hearts deny the holy God who reigns: “There is no God! There is no God,” this generation claims. Our God looks down on humankind with penetrating eye to see if there are any wise who seek the Lord on high. 2 The Lord finds all have turned aside from doing what is right, that all have strayed, not one does good, not one within God’s sight. Have they no knowledge, who consume God’s own as they eat bread, who do not call upon the Lord, who will not bow their head? 3 But they will all be terrified, for God is on the throne. Though evil ones oppress the poor, you, Lord, will help your own. O Lord, send us deliverance; restore us; hear our voice. When Zion’s restoration comes, God’s people will rejoice."
336,We Gather Together,"1 We gather together to ask the Lord's blessing; he chastens and hastens his will to make known; the wicked oppressing now cease from distressing. Sing praises to his name; he forgets not his own. 2 Beside us to guide us, our God with us joining, ordaining, maintaining his kingdom divine; so from the beginning the fight we were winning; thou, Lord, wast at our side; all glory be thine! 3 We all do extol thee, thou leader triumphant, and pray that thou still our defender wilt be. Let thy congregation escape tribulation; thy name be ever praised! O Lord, make us free!"
337,"My Country, 'Tis of Thee","1 My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing: land where my *fathers died, land of the pilgrims' pride, from every mountainside let freedom ring. 2 My native country, thee, land of the noble free, thy name I love; I love thy rocks and rills, thy woods and templed hills; my heart with rapture thrills like that above. 3 Let music swell the breeze, and ring from all the trees sweet freedom's song. Let mortal tongues awake; let all that breathe partake; let rocks their silence break, the sound prolong. 4 Our *fathers' God, to thee, author of liberty, to thee we sing. Long may our land be bright with freedom's holy light; protect us by thy might, great God, our King. *Or “parents”"
338,O Beautiful for Spacious Skies,"1 O beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain, for purple mountain majesties above the fruited plain! America! America! God shed his grace on thee, and crown thy good with *brotherhood from sea to shining sea! 2 O beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife, who more than self their country loved, and mercy more than life! America! America! God mend thine every flaw; confirm thy soul in self-control, thy liberty in law! 3 O beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam, undimmed by human tears! America! America! May God thy gold refine till all success be nobleness and every gain divine! *Or “servanthood”"
339,Lift Every Voice and Sing,"1 Lift every voice and sing till earth and heaven ring, ring with the harmonies of liberty. Let our rejoicing rise high as the listening skies; let it resound loud as the rolling sea. Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us; sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us. Facing the rising sun of our new day begun, let us march on, till victory is won. 2 Stony the road we trod, bitter the chastening rod, felt in the days when hope unborn had died. Yet, with a steady beat, have not our weary feet come to the place for which our parents sighed? We have come over a way that with tears has been watered; we have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered, out from the gloomy past, till now we stand at last where the white gleam of our bright star is cast. 3 God of our weary years, God of our silent tears, thou who hast brought us thus far on the way; thou who hast by thy might led us into the light, keep us forever in the path, we pray. Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met thee; lest, our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget thee; shadowed beneath thy hand may we forever stand, true to our God, true to our native land."
340,This Is My Song,"1 This is my song, O God of all the nations, a song of peace for lands afar and mine. This is my home, the country where my heart is; here are my hopes, my dreams, my holy shrine; but other hearts in other lands are beating with hopes and dreams as true and high as mine. 2 My country’s skies are bluer than the ocean, and sunlight beams on cloverleaf and pine. But other lands have sunlight too, and clover, and skies are everywhere as blue as mine. So hear my song, O God of all the nations, a song of peace for their land and for mine. 3 This is my prayer, O Lord of all earth's kingdoms: thy kingdom come; on earth thy will be done. Let Christ be lifted up till all shall serve him, and hearts united learn to live as one. So hear my prayer, O God of all the nations: myself I give thee; let thy will be done."
341,"O God, Show Mercy to Us","1 O God, show mercy to us, and bless us with your grace; and cause to shine upon us the brightness of your face, so that your way most holy on earth may soon be known, and unto every people your saving grace be shown. Let all the peoples praise you; let all the nations sing; in every land let praises and songs of gladness ring. 2 For you will judge the peoples in truth and righteousness, and on the earth all nations will your just rule confess. Let all the peoples praise you; let all the nations sing. Then earth in rich abundance to us its fruit will bring. The Lord our God will bless us; our God will blessing send, and all the earth will worship to its remotest end."
342,"Judge Eternal, Throned in Splendor","1 Judge Eternal, throned in splendor, Lord of lords and King of kings, with your living fire of judgment purge this land of bitter things; solace all its wide dominion with the healing of your wings. 2 Still the weary folk are pining for the hour that brings release, and the city’s crowded clangor cries aloud for sin to cease, and the homesteads and the woodlands plead in silence for their peace. 3 Crown, O God, your own endeavor; cleave our darkness with your sword; feed the faithless and the hungry with the richness of your word; cleanse the body of this nation through the glory of the Lord."
343,Where Cross the Crowded Ways of Life,"1 Where cross the crowded ways of life, where sound the cries of race and clan, above the noise of selfish strife, we hear your voice, O Son of Man. 2 In haunts of wretchedness and need, on shadowed thresholds fraught with fears, from paths where hide the lures of greed, we catch the vision of your tears. 3 From tender childhood's helplessness, from human grief and burdened toil, from famished souls, from sorrow's stress, your heart has never known recoil. 4 The cup of water given for you still holds the freshness of your grace; yet long these multitudes to view the sweet compassion of your face. 5 O Master, from the mountainside, make haste to heal these hearts of pain; among these restless throngs abide; O tread the city's streets again; 6 Till all the world shall learn your love, and follow where your feet have trod; till glorious from your heaven above shall come the city of our God."
344,Where Armies Scourge the Countryside,"1 Where armies scourge the countryside, and people flee in fear, where sirens scream through flaming nights, and death is ever near: Refrain: O God of mercy, hear our prayer. Bring peace to earth again! 2 Where anger festers in the heart, and strikes with cruel hand; where violence stalks the troubled streets, and terror haunts the land:	(Refrain) 3 Where homes are torn by bitter strife, and love dissolves in blame; where walls you meant for sheltering care hide deeds of hurt and shame: 	(Refrain) 4 O God, whose heart compassionate bears every human pain, redeem this violent, wounding world till gentleness shall reign. 	(Refrain)"
345,In an Age of Twisted Values,"1 In an age of twisted values we have lost the truth we need. In sophisticated language we have justified our greed. By our struggle for possessions we have robbed the poor and weak. Hear our cry and heal our nation; your forgiveness, Lord, we seek. 2 We have built discrimination on our prejudice and fear. Hatred swiftly turns to cruelty if we hold resentments dear. For communities divided by the walls of class and race, hear our cry and heal our nation; show us, Lord, your love and grace. 3 When our families are broken, when our homes are full of strife, when our children are bewildered, when they lose their way in life, when we fail to give the aged all the care we know they need, hear our cry and heal our nation; help us show more love, we plead. 4 We who hear your word so often choose so rarely to obey. Turn us from our willful wandering; give us truth to light our way. In the power of your Spirit come to cleanse us, make us new; hear our cry and heal our nation till our nation honors you."
346,For the Healing of the Nations,"1 For the healing of the nations, Lord, we pray with one accord; for a just and equal sharing of the things that earth affords; to a life of love in action help us rise and pledge our word. 2 Lead us forward into freedom; from despair your world release, that, redeemed from war and hatred, all may come and go in peace. Show us how through care and goodness fear will die and hope increase. 3 All that kills abundant living, let it from the earth be banned: pride of status, race, or schooling, dogmas that obscure your plan. In our common quest for justice may we hallow life's brief span. 4 You, Creator God, have written your great name on humankind; for our growing in your likeness, bring the life of Christ to mind, that by our response and service earth its destiny may find."
347,Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence,"1 Let all mortal flesh keep silence, and with fear and trembling stand; ponder nothing earthly minded, for with blessing in his hand Christ our God to earth descendeth, our full homage to demand. 2 King of kings, yet born of Mary, as of old on earth he stood, Lord of lords, in human vesture, in the body and the blood, he will give to all the faithful his own self for heavenly food. 3 Rank on rank the host of heaven spreads its vanguard on the way, as the Light of light descendeth from the realms of endless day, that the powers of hell may vanish as the shadows clear away. 4 At his feet the six-winged seraph, cherubim, with sleepless eye, veil their faces to the presence, as with ceaseless voice they cry, “Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, Lord most high!”"
348,"Lo, He Comes with Clouds Descending","1 Lo, he comes with clouds descending, once for our salvation slain; thousand, thousand saints attending join to sing the glad refrain: Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

See the day of God appear! 3 Yea, amen, let all adore thee, high on thine eternal throne; Savior, take the power and glory; claim the kingdom as thine own. Come, Lord Jesus; come, Lord Jesus; come, Lord Jesus. Thou shalt reign, and thou alone!"
349,"""Sleepers, Wake!"" A Voice Astounds Us","1 “Sleepers, wake!” A voice astounds us; the shout of rampart guards surrounds us: “Awake, Jerusalem, arise!” Midnight’s peace their cry has broken, their urgent summons clearly spoken: “The time has come, O maidens wise! Rise up, and give us light; the Bridegroom is in sight. Alleluia! Your lamps prepare and hasten there, that you the wedding feast may share.” 2 Zion hears the watchmen singing; her heart with joyful hope is springing; she wakes and hurries through the night. Forth he comes, her Bridegroom glorious in strength of grace, in truth victorious: her star is risen, her light grows bright. Now come, most worthy Lord, God’s Son, incarnate Word, Alleluia! We follow all and heed your call to come into the banquet hall. 3 Lamb of God, the heavens adore you; let saints and angels sing before you, as harps and cymbals swell the sound. Twelve great pearls, the city’s portals: through them we stream to join the immortals as we with joy your throne surround. No eye has known the sight, no ear heard such delight: Alleluia! Therefore we sing to greet our King; for ever let our praises ring."

(Refrain) 4 Every round goes higher, higher; every round goes higher, higher; every round goes higher, higher, for the time is drawing nigh. 	(Refrain)"
351,All Who Love and Serve Your City,"1 All who love and serve your city, all who bear its daily stress, all who cry for peace and justice, all who curse and all who bless: 2 In your day of wealth and plenty, wasted work and wasted play, call to mind the word of Jesus, ""You must work while it is day."" 3 For all days are days of judgment, and the Lord is waiting still, drawing near a world that spurns him, offering peace from Calvary's hill. 4 Risen Lord, shall yet the city be the city of despair? Come today, our judge, our glory. Be its name “The Lord is there!"""
352,My Lord! What a Morning,"Refrain: My Lord! what a morning; my Lord! what a morning; O my Lord! what a morning, when the stars begin to fall, when the stars begin to fall. 1 You will hear the trumpet sound to wake the nations underground, looking to my God's right hand, when the stars begin to fall.	(Refrain) 2 You will hear the sinner cry, to wake the nations underground, looking to my God's right hand, when the stars begin to fall.

353,My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less,"1 My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness; I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name. Refrain: On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand; all other ground is sinking sand; all other ground is sinking sand. 2 When darkness seems to hide his face, I rest on his unchanging grace; in every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds within the veil.	(Refrain) 3 His oath, his covenant, his blood support me in the whelming flood; when all around my soul gives way, he then is all my hope and stay.	(Refrain) 4 When he shall come with trumpet sound, O may I then in him be found, dressed in his righteousness alone, faultless to stand before the throne.	(Refrain)"
354,Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory,"1 Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; he is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; he has loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword. God’s truth is marching on. Refrain: Glory, glory hallelujah! Glory, glory hallelujah! Glory, glory hallelujah! God’s truth is marching on. 2 God has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat and is sifting out all human hearts before the judgment seat; O be swift, my soul, to answer; O be jubilant my feet! Our God is marching on.	(Refrain) 3 In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea, with a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me; as he died to make us holy, let us live to make all free, while God is marching on.	(Refrain)"
355,"O Hear Our Cry, O Lord","1 O hear our cry, O Lord; now hear us as we pray. You guide us as a shepherd leads, so keep us in your way.

O come; Lord, come; restore and save us now."
356,"Sing Praise to God, Whose Mighty Acts","1 Sing praise to God, whose mighty acts still strong in memory stand to give us hope when evil seems to gain the upper hand. Give thanks for deeds of steadfast love, for wonders new and old: for fire and cloud, for daily food, for mercies yet untold. 2 Though monuments of evil rise in marble, gilt, and stone, time’s search will find their boasts untrue, their makers’ names unknown. Mute avenues of ruins will mark where once proud cities stood, but from destruction God will save the faithful, just, and good. 3 Rise up, O God, reclaim the power usurped by mortal pride; deflate the hollow pomp of those whom rank and titles hide. Let not the needy cry unheard, the suffering hope in vain; restore the fallen, bless the meek, till peace and justice reign."
357,The Days Are Surely Coming,"1 The days are surely coming, says God to all the earth, when you will see my promise: salvation come to birth. My righteousness and justice will spread throughout the land and you will be delivered by my almighty hand. 2 The days are surely coming, says Christ, the promised one, when you will read my warning in moon and stars and sun. Though earth and heaven tremble, stand up and do not fear, for I am your redeemer, and I am drawing near. 3 The days are surely coming when we will know at last the fullness of God’s presence, God’s promise, come to pass. Then righteousness and justice will spread throughout the land and we will be delivered by God’s almighty hand."
358,Steal Away,"Refrain: Steal away, steal away, steal away to Jesus! Steal away, steal away home; I ain't got long to stay here. 1 My Lord, he calls me; he calls me by the thunder. The trumpet sounds within my soul; I ain’t got long to stay here.	(Refrain) 2 Green trees are bending; poor sinners stand a trembling.

Christ is coming! Let each heart repeat the song. 4 Long your exiles have been pining for your promised rest and home, but in heavenly glory shining, soon the risen Christ shall come. Christ is coming! Christ is coming! Joyful, shout the victory psalm."
361,"O Christ, the Great Foundation","1 O Christ, the great foundation on which your people stand to preach your true salvation in every age and land: pour out your Holy Spirit to make us strong and pure, to keep the faith unbroken as long as worlds endure. 2 Baptized in one confession, one church in all the earth, we bear our Lord's impression, the sign of second birth: one holy people gathered in love beyond our own, by grace we were invited; by grace we make you known. 3 Where tyrants' hold is tightened, where strong devour the weak, where innocents are frightened, the righteous fear to speak, there let your church awaking attack the powers of sin and, all their ramparts breaking, with you the victory win. 4 This is the moment glorious when he who once was dead shall lead his church victorious, their champion and their head. The Lord of all creation his heavenly kingdom brings: the final consummation, the glory of all things"

When will this new day start? We long for peace and comfort to reign within each heart. Yet not in our lives only, nor simply in our home: we pray that all creation will one day find shalom. 3 When wars of desolation and hate come to an end, when nation meets with nation and calls the other “friend,” still peace in all its fullness will only have begun: shalom for all creation begins with justice done. 4 That little child shall lead us to walk the chosen way, to share the peaceful kingdom, to greet God’s newborn day. The child born in a stable is sent to break our chains, to bring through word and table the day when justice reigns."

Sparks that are sown in us like seed: names for our God, dreams, signs, and wonders sent from the past are what we need. We in this place remember and speak again what we have heard: God’s free redeeming word. 3 And we accept bread at his table, broken and shared, a living sign.

Those who do good and speak the truth, whose lives are blameless still; 2 Who have no guile upon their tongues nor harm their neighbor's life, but honor those who fear the Lord and turn away from strife; 3 Who do no wrong, but keep their word and seek no bribe or gain. All those who do such things shall live and safe from harm remain."

Let my praise and worship start with the cleansing of my heart. 2 Save me from the soothing sin of the empty cultic deed and the pious, babbling din of the claimed but unlived creed. Let my actions, Lord, express what my tongue and lips profess. 3 When I bend upon my knees, clasp my hands, or bow my head, let my spoken, public pleas be directly, simply said, free of tangled words that mask what my soul would plainly ask. 4 When I dance or chant your praise, when I sing a psalm or hymn, when I preach your loving ways, let my heart add its Amen. Let each cherished outward rite thus reflect your inward light."

432,"How Clear Is Our Vocation, Lord","1 How clear is our vocation, Lord, when once we heed your call to live according to your word and daily learn, refreshed, restored, that you are Lord of all and will not let us fall. 2 But if, forgetful, we should find your yoke is hard to bear; if worldly pressures fray the mind and love itself cannot unwind its tangled skein of care: our inward life repair. 3 We marvel how your saints became in hindrances more sure: whose joyful virtues put to shame the casual way we wear your name, and by our faults obscure your power to cleanse and cure. 4 In what you give us, Lord, to do, together or alone, in old routines or ventures new, may we not cease to look to you: the cross you hung upon, all you endeavored, done."
433,Sign Us with Ashes,"Refrain: Sign us with ashes, merciful God, children of dust, as to dust we return. Sign us with ashes, merciful God.

(Refrain) 2 Surely, you alone uphold us. You give us strength for all our needs. Shielding with a father’s favor, you bless us with pardon and peace. 	(Refrain) 3 Surely, you alone can heal us. Yours is the will to make us whole. Soothing with a mother’s kindness, the contrite of heart, you console. 	(Refrain) 4 Surely, you alone can free us. You break the bonds of guilt and sin. Bracing, till we walk uprightly, you bolster our hope once again. 	(Refrain) 5 Surely, you alone refine us. You give us grace for lives made new, forging, through your fire and radiance, a sacrifice worthy for you. 	(Refrain) 6 Surely, you alone redeem us. You fill our dust with holy breath. Bursting from the grave in glory, you rise from the ashes of death! 	(Refrain)"
434,"Restore in Us, O God","1 Restore in us, O God, the splendor of your love; renew your image in our hearts, and all our sins remove. 2 O Spirit, wake in us the wonder of your power; from fruitless fear unfurl our lives like springtime bud and flower. 3 Bring us, O Christ, to share the fullness of your joy; baptize us in the risen life that death cannot destroy. 4 Three-personed God, fulfill the promise of your grace, that we, when all our searching ends, may see you face to face."
435,There's a Wideness in God's Mercy,"1 There's a wideness in God's mercy, like the wideness of the sea. There's a kindness in God's justice, which is more than liberty. There is no place where earth's sorrows are more felt than up in heaven. There is no place where earth's failings have such kindly judgment given. 2 For the love of God is broader than the measures of the mind. And the heart of the Eternal is most wonderfully kind. If our love were but more faithful, we would gladly trust God's Word, and our lives reflect thanksgiving for the goodness of our Lord."

What shall we fear, with your power to protect us, we who walk forth in your greatness confiding?"
437,"You Are the Lord, Giver of Mercy!","You are the Lord, giver of mercy! You are the Christ, giver of mercy! You are the Lord, giver of mercy!"
438,"Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me","1 Rock of Ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee. Let the water and the blood from thy wounded side which flowed be of sin the double cure, cleanse from guilt and make me pure. 2 Not the labors of my hands can fulfill thy law’s demands. Could my zeal no respite know, could my tears forever flow, all for sin could not atone. Thou must save, and thou alone. 3 Nothing in my hand I bring; simply to thy cross I cling; naked, come to thee for dress, helpless, look to thee for grace; foul, I to the fountain fly; wash me, Savior, or I die. 4 While I draw this fleeting breath, when my eyelids close in death, when I soar to worlds unknown, see thee on thy judgment throne, Rock of Ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee."

Leave, ah! leave me not alone; still support and comfort me. All my trust on thee is stayed; all my help from thee I bring. Cover my defenseless head with the shadow of thy wing. 3 Thou, O Christ, art all I want; more than all in thee I find. Raise the fallen, cheer the faint, heal the sick, and lead the blind. Just and holy is thy name; I am all unrighteousness. False and full of sin I am; thou art full of truth and grace. 4 Plenteous grace with thee is found, grace to cover all my sin. Let the healing streams abound; make and keep me pure within. Thou of life the fountain art; freely let me take of thee. Spring thou up within my heart. Rise to all eternity."

A priest who shares our human pain, Christ intercedes. 3 Who dares to throw the stone to damn another's sin, when you, while knowing all our past, forgive again? No more we play the judge, for by your grace we live. As you, O God, forgive our sin, may we forgive."

Your hand was heavy on me; my life found no relief. But when I made confession and hid no sin from you, when I revealed my failings, you gave me life anew. 3 So let the godly seek you, when troubling times are near; no storm or flood shall reach them, nor cause their hearts to fear.

674,"I Call, O Lord, on You","1 I call, O Lord, on you: come quickly to my aid; hear from your throne in heaven above my cry of deep distress. 2 Lord, let my prayer ascend like incense in your sight; see in my hands to heaven above my evening sacrifice. 3 Set, Lord, a guard to keep close watch upon my mouth; let no rebellious word escape your seal upon my lips. 4 Have pity, Lord, on me; you are my strength, my shield: you are my refuge in all ills; I turn in trust to you."
675,"All Praise to Thee, My God, This Night","1 All praise to thee, my God, this night, for all the blessings of the light! Keep me, O keep me safe from harm within the shelter of thine arm! 2 Forgive me, Lord, through Christ, I pray, the wrong that I have done this day, that I, before I sleep, may be at peace with neighbor, self, and thee. 3 O may my soul on thee repose, and with sweet sleep mine eyelids close. Refresh my strength, for thine own sake, to serve thee well when I awake. 4 Praise God, from whom all blessings flow; praise God, all creatures here below; praise God above, ye heavenly host; praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."
676,Day Is Done,"1 Day is done, but love unfailing dwells ever here; shadows fall, but hope, prevailing, calms every fear. God, our Maker, none forsaking, take our hearts, of love's own making; watch our sleeping; guard our waking; be always near. 2 Dark descends, but light unending shines through our night; you are with us, ever lending new strength to sight: one in love, your truth confessing, one in hope of heaven's blessing, may we see, in love's possessing, love's endless light! 3 Eyes will close, but you unsleeping watch by our side. Death may come; in love's safekeeping still we abide. God of love, all evil quelling, sin forgiving, fear dispelling, stay with us, our hearts indwelling, this eventide."
677,"The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, Is Ended","1 The day thou gavest, Lord, is ended; the darkness falls at thy behest. To thee our morning hymns ascended; thy praise shall hallow now our rest. 2 We thank thee that thy church unsleeping, while earth rolls onward into light, through all the world a watch is keeping and rests not now by day or night. 3 As o’er each continent and island the dawn leads on another day, the voice of prayer is never silent, nor dies the song of praise away. 4 The sun that bids us rest is waking thy children ‘neath the western sky, and hour by hour fresh lips are making thy wondrous doings heard on high. 5 So be it, Lord; thy throne shall never, like earth's proud empires, pass away; thy kingdom stands, and grows forever until there dawns thy glorious day."
678,Our Darkness Is Never Darkness in Your Sight,Our darkness is never darkness in your sight: the deepest night is clear as the daylight. French: La ténèbre n’est point ténèbre devant toi: la nuit comme le jour est lumière.
679,Let the Whole Creation Cry,"1 Let the whole creation cry, ""Glory to the Lord on high."" Heaven and earth, awake and sing, ""Praise to our almighty King."" Praise God, angel hosts above, ever bright and fair in love; sun and moon, uplift your voice; night and stars, in God rejoice! 2 Men and women, young and old, raise the anthem loud and bold; join with children's songs of praise; worship God through length of days. From the north to southern pole let the mighty chorus roll: ""Holy, holy, holy One, glory be to God alone!"""
680,Soft Rains of Spring Flow,"1 Soft rains of spring flow through the fields; earth awakes and greets a new year. Deep within the soil of our hearts seeds of love begin to take root. Summer brings floods, tempest and storm; sun breaks forth; birds tend their young. Then the day of harvest will come, when we gather all that God gives. 2 Tender young shoots, green in the sun, glisten with the beauty of spring. God will watch and care for each one, bring the growth and strength to bear fruit, speaking the word, quenching their thirst, hearing their prayer, feeding their souls. God will love and care for each one, till the bright day harvest will come. 3 Our hearts are filled: God gives us grace; overflowing we give our praise. We come humbly bringing our thanks, bring our hearts and offer them back. Our harvest here on God’s rich earth, all is a gift God freely makes. Lord and Savior, we sing your praise, thank and bless you all of our days."
681,This Is the Day the Lord Hath Made,"1 This is the day the Lord hath made; the hours are all God's own. Let heaven rejoice; let earth be glad, and praise surround the throne. 2 Hosanna to the anointed King, to David's holy Son! Help us, O Lord; descend and bring salvation from the throne. 3 Blest be the Lord, who comes in power with messages of grace, who comes in this accepted hour to save our sinful race. 4 Hosanna in the highest strains the church on earth can raise! The highest heavens in which God reigns shall now resound with praise."
682,It Is Good to Sing Your Praises,"1 It is good to sing your praises and to thank you, O Most High, showing forth your loving kindness when the morning lights the sky. It is good when night is falling of your faithfulness to tell, while with sweet, melodious praises songs of adoration swell. 2 You have filled my heart with gladness through the works your hands have wrought; you have made my life victorious; great your works and deep your thought. You, O Lord, on high exalted, reign forevermore in might; all your enemies shall perish, sin be banished from your sight. 3 But the good shall live before you, planted in your dwelling place, fruited trees and ever verdant, nourished by your boundless grace. In his goodness to the righteous God his righteousness displays; God, my rock, my strength and refuge, just and true are all your ways."
683,Lord of All Hopefulness,"1 Lord of all hopefulness, Lord of all joy, whose trust, ever childlike, no cares could destroy: be there at our waking and give us, we pray, your bliss in our hearts, Lord, at the break of the day. 2 Lord of all eagerness, Lord of all faith, whose strong hands were skilled at the plane and the lathe: be there at our labors and give us, we pray, your strength in our hearts, Lord, at the noon of the day. 3 Lord of all kindliness, Lord of all grace, your hands swift to welcome, your arms to embrace: be there at our homing and give us, we pray, your love in our hearts, Lord, at the eve of the day. 4 Lord of all gentleness, Lord of all calm, whose voice is contentment, whose presence is balm: be there at our sleeping and give us, we pray, your peace in our hearts, Lord, at the end of the day."
684,Faith Begins by Letting Go,"1 Faith begins by letting go, giving up what had seemed sure, taking risks and pressing on, though the way feels less secure: pilgrimage both right and odd, trusting all our life to God. 2 Faith endures by holding on, keeping memory’s roots alive so that hope may bear its fruit; promise-fed, our souls will thrive, not through merit we possess but by God’s great faithfulness. 3 Faith matures by reaching out, stretching minds, enlarging hearts, sharing struggles, living prayer, binding up the broken parts; till we find the commonplace ripe with witness to God’s grace."
685,"Unseen God, Your Hand Has Guided","1 Unseen God, your hand has guided these two lives on separate ways till they heard your call to travel hand in hand through all their days. 2 You have made them in your image, formed them for community. Bless their hands, now linked together, yoked in love that sets them free. 3 May their fingers, intertwining, weave a stronger bond to bear burdens future years may bring them: stress of duty, weight of care. 4 Shape their hands, O God, for sharing: open, reaching out to give. Make their hearts, as you have shown us, quick, when wounded, to forgive. 5 God, through all the years before them, let your hand their hands uphold. On their unseen way befriend them; with your love their love enfold."
686,God of Our Life,"1 God of our life, through all the circling years, we trust in thee. In all the past, through all our hopes and fears, thy hand we see. With each new day, when morning lifts the veil, we own thy mercies, Lord, which never fail. 2 God of the past, our times are in thy hand. With us abide. Lead us by faith to hope's true promised land. Be thou our guide. With thee to bless, the darkness shines as light, and faith's fair vision changes into sight. 3 God of the coming years, through paths unknown we follow thee. When we are strong, Lord, leave us not alone. Our refuge be. Be thou for us in life our daily bread, our heart's true home when all our years have sped."
687,"Our God, Our Help in Ages Past","1 Our God, our help in ages past, our hope for years to come, our shelter from the stormy blast, and our eternal home: 2 Beneath the shadow of thy throne thy saints have dwelt secure; sufficient is thine arm alone, and our defense is sure. 3 Before the hills in order stood, or earth received its frame, from everlasting thou art God, to endless years the same. 4 A thousand ages in thy sight are like an evening gone, short as the watch that ends the night before the rising sun. 5 Time, like an ever rolling stream, bears all our years away; they fly forgotten, as a dream dies at the opening day. 6 Our God, our help in ages past, our hope for years to come, be thou our guard while life shall last, and our eternal home."
688,"Spirit of God, Descend upon My Heart","1 Spirit of God, descend upon my heart; wean it from earth, through all its pulses move; stoop to my weakness, mighty as thou art, and make me love thee as I ought to love. 2 I ask no dream, no prophet ecstasies, no sudden rending of the veil of clay, no angel visitant, no opening skies; but take the dimness of my soul away. 3 Hast thou not bid us love thee, God and King; all, all thine own, soul, heart, and strength, and mind? I see thy cross; there teach my heart to cling. O let me seek thee, and O let me find! 4 Teach me to feel that thou art always nigh. Teach me the struggles of the soul to bear, to check the rising doubt, the rebel sigh. Teach me the patience of unanswered prayer. 5 Teach me to love thee as thine angels love, one holy passion filling all my frame; the baptism of the heaven-descended Dove, my heart an altar, and thy love the flame."
689,When the Morning Stars Together,"1 When the morning stars together their Creator's glory sang, and the angel host all shouted till with joy the heavens rang, then your wisdom and your greatness their exultant music told, all the beauty and the splendor which your mighty works unfold. 2 When in synagogue and temple voices raised the psalmists' songs, offering up the adoration which alone to you belongs; when the singers, trumpets, cymbals all combined, your praise to share, awestruck people saw your glory fill the sacred house of prayer. 3 Voice and instrument in union through the ages spoke your praise. Plain-song, tuneful hymns, and anthems told your faithful, gracious ways. Choir and orchestra and organ each a sacred offering brought, while, inspired by your own Spirit, poet and composer wrought. 4 Lord, we bring our gift of music; touch our lips and fire our hearts. Teach our minds and train our senses; fit us for these sacred arts. Then with skill and consecration we would serve you, Lord, and give all our powers to glorify you, and in serving fully live."
690,God's Glory Fills the Heavens,"1 God’s glory fills the heavens with hymns; the domed sky bears the Maker’s mark; new praises sound from day to day and echo through the knowing dark. Without a word their songs roll on; into all lands their voices run. And with a champion’s strength and grace from farthest heaven comes forth the sun. 2 God’s perfect law revives the soul; its precepts make the simple wise; its just commands rejoice the heart; its truth gives light unto the eyes. Forever shall this law endure: unblemished, righteous, true, complete. No gold was ever found so fine, no honey in the comb more sweet. 3 God’s servant may I ever be: this world my joy, that word my guide. O cleanse me, Lord, from secret sin: deliver me from selfish pride. Accept my thoughts and words and deeds: let them find favor in your sight. For you alone can make me whole, O Lord, my refuge and my might."
691,"Lord, When I Came into This Life","1 Lord, when I came into this life you called me by my name; today I come, commit myself, responding to your claim. 2 Within the circle of the faith, as member of your cast, I take my place with all the saints of future, present, past. 3 In all the tensions of my life, between my faith and doubt, let your great Spirit give me hope, sustain me, lead me out. 4 So help me in my unbelief and let my life be true: feet firmly planted on the earth, my sights set high on you."
692,"Spirit, Open My Heart","Refrain: Spirit, open my heart to the joy and pain of living. As you love may I love, in receiving and in giving. Spirit, open my heart. 1 God, replace my stony heart with a heart that's kind and tender. All my coldness and fear to your grace I now surrender.	(Refrain) 2 Write your love upon my heart as my law, my goal, my story. In each thought, word, and deed, may my living bring you glory. 	(Refrain) 3 May I weep with those who weep; share the joy of sister, brother. In the welcome of Christ, may we welcome one another. 	(Refrain)"
693,Though I May Speak,"1 Though I may speak with bravest fire, and have the gift to all inspire, and have not love, my words are vain, as sounding brass, and hopeless gain. 2 Though I may give all I possess, and striving so my love profess, but not be given by love within, the profit soon turns strangely thin. 3 Come, Spirit, come, our hearts control; our spirits long to be made whole. Let inward love guide every deed; by this we worship, and are freed."
694,Great God of Every Blessing,"1 Great God of every blessing, of faithful, loving care, you are the fount of goodness, the daily bread we share. How can we hope to thank you? Our praise is but a start: sincerely and completely I offer you my heart. 2 Your Word is our salvation, the source of endless grace, in death and life extending your covenant embrace. In Christ we are one body; each member has a part: sincerely and completely I offer you my heart. 3 Your Spirit is our teacher, the light that guides our search, transforming broken people into the holy church. For feeding us with mercy, for wisdom you impart: sincerely and completely I offer you my heart."
695,"Change My Heart, O God",
696,"O God, You Are My God Alone","1 O God, you are my God alone, whom eagerly I seek, though longing fills my soul with thirst and leaves my body weak. Just as a dry and barren land awaits a freshening shower, I long within your house to see your glory and your power. 2 Your faithful love surpasses life, evoking all my praise. Through every day, to bless your name, my hands in joy I’ll raise. My deepest needs you satisfy as with a sumptuous feast. So, on my lips and in my heart, your praise has never ceased. 3 Throughout the night I lie in bed and call you, Lord, to mind; in darkest hours I meditate how God, my strength, is kind. Beneath the shadow of your wing, I live and feel secure; and daily as I follow close, your right hand keeps me sure."
697,Take My Life,"1 Take my life and let it be consecrated, Lord, to thee; take my moments and my days; let them flow in ceaseless praise; let them flow in ceaseless praise. 2 Take my hands and let them move at the impulse of thy love; take my feet and let them be swift and beautiful for thee, swift and beautiful for thee. 3 Take my voice and let me sing always, only, for my King; take my lips and let them be filled with messages from thee, filled with messages from thee. 4 Take my sliver and my gold; not a mite would I withhold; take my intellect and use every power as thou shalt choose, every power as thou shalt choose. 5 Take my will and make it thine; it shall be no longer mine. Take my heart, it is thine own; it shall be thy royal throne, it shall be thy royal throne. 6 Take my love; my Lord, I pour at thy feet its treasure store; take myself and I will be ever, only, all for thee, ever, only, all for thee."
698,"Take, O Take Me as I Am","Take, O take me as I am; summon out what I shall be; set your seal upon my heart and live in me."
699,Fill My Cup,"Refrain: Fill my cup; let it overflow; fill my cup; let it overflow; fill my cup; let it overflow; let it overflow with love. 1 Lord, let me be your instrument, spreading sunshine in the land; let people see your works in me; help me live the best I can.	(Refrain) 2 It’s my desire to live for you and to always walk upright; give me the strength to face each day; stay with me through each dark night. 	(Refrain)"
700,I'm Gonna Live So God Can Use Me,"1 I’m gonna live so God can use me anywhere, Lord, anytime! I’m gonna live so God can use me anywhere, Lord, anytime! 2 I’m gonna work so God can use me anywhere, Lord, anytime! I’m gonna work so God can use me anywhere, Lord, anytime! 3 I’m gonna pray so God can use me anywhere, Lord, anytime! I’m gonna pray so God can use me anywhere, Lord, anytime! 4 I’m gonna sing so God can use me anywhere, Lord, anytime! I’m gonna sing so God can use me anywhere, Lord, anytime!"
701,"Lord, Prepare Me","Lord, prepare me to be a sanctuary, pure and holy, tried and true. With thanksgiving, I’ll be a living sanctuary for you."
702,Christ Be Beside Me,"1 Christ be beside me; Christ be before me; Christ be behind me, King of my heart. Christ be within me; Christ be below me; Christ be above me, never to part. 2 Christ on my right hand, Christ on my left hand, Christ all around me, shield in the strife. Christ in my sleeping, Christ in my sitting, Christ in my rising, Light of my life. 3 Christ be in all hearts thinking about me; Christ be on all tongues telling of me. Christ be the vision in eyes that see me; in ears that hear me Christ ever be."
703,"Jesus, Thy Boundless Love to Me","1 Jesus, thy boundless love to me no thought can reach, no tongue declare; O knit my thankful heart to thee, and reign without a rival there! Thine wholly, thine alone, I’d live; myself to thee entirely give. 2 O grant that nothing in my soul may dwell, but thy pure love alone; O may thy love possess me whole, my joy, my treasure, and my crown! All coldness from my heart remove; may every act, word, thought be love. 3 O Love, how gracious is thy way! All fear before thy presence flies; care, anguish, sorrow melt away where’er thy healing beams arise. O Jesus, nothing may I see, nothing desire, or seek, but thee."
704,To My Precious Lord,
705,You Are Holy,"Part 1 You are holy; you are mighty; you are worthy, worthy of praise. I will follow; I will listen; I will love you all of my days. I will sing to and worship the King who is worthy. I will love and adore him; I will bow down before him. I will sing to and worship the King who is worthy. I will love and adore him; I will bow down before him. You’re my Prince of Peace, and I will live my life for you. Part 2 You are holy; you are mighty; you are worthy, worthy of praise. I will follow; I will listen; I will love you all of my days. You are Lord of lords; you are King of kings; you are mighty God, Lord of everything.

You are Alpha, Omega, Beginning and End. You’re my Savior, Messiah, Redeemer, and Friend. You’re my Prince of Peace, and I will live my life for you."
706,Commit Your Way to God the Lord,"1 Commit your way to God the Lord: your cause will shine as bright as fire; delight to do God’s holy word and you shall find what you desire. 2 Be still before the Lord and wait, and do not fret when wrong succeeds; refrain from anger, turn from hate, for God will punish evil deeds. 3 Salvation comes from God alone: the faithful know their help is sure; to heaven, all our needs are known, and in God’s strength we are secure. 4 Commit your way to God the Lord; to peace and truth and grace aspire; then mercy shall be your reward; God's promises, your heart's desire."
707,"Take Thou Our Minds, Dear Lord","1 Take thou our minds, dear Lord, we humbly pray; give us the mind of Christ each passing day; teach us to know the truth that sets us free; grant us in all our thoughts to honor thee. 2 Take thou our hearts, O Christ; they are thine own; come thou within our souls and claim thy throne; help us to shed abroad thy deathless love; use us to make the earth like heaven above. 3 Take thou our wills, Most High! Hold thou full sway; have in our inmost souls thy perfect way; guard thou each sacred hour from selfish ease; guide thou our ordered lives as thou dost please. 4 Take thou ourselves, O Lord, heart, mind, and will; through our surrendered souls thy plans fulfill. We yield ourselves to thee: time, talents, all; we hear, and henceforth heed, thy sovereign call."
708,We Give Thee but Thine Own,"1 We give thee but thine own, whate'er the gift may be; all that we have is thine alone, a trust, O Lord, from thee. 2 May we thy bounties thus as stewards true receive, and gladly, as thou blessest us, to thee our firstfruits give. 3 The captive to release, to God the lost to bring, to teach the way of life and peace: it is a Christ-like thing. 4 And we believe thy word, though dim our faith may be; whate'er we do for thine, O Lord, we do it unto thee."
709,"God, We Honor You","God, we honor you. God, we trust in you. God, we worship and adore you. Take what we bring, offered to you. Teach us to show your abundant blessings. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, amen."
710,We Lift Our Voices,"We lift our voices; we lift our hands; we lift our lives up to you: we are an offering. Lord, use our voices; Lord, use our hands; Lord, use our lives; they are yours: we are an offering. All that we have, all that we are, all that we hope to be, we give to you, we give to you. We lift our voices; we lift our hands; we lift our lives up to you: we are an offering; we are an offering."
711,Lord of All Good,"1 Lord of all good, our gifts we bring to you; use them your holy purpose to fulfill, tokens of love and pledges brought anew, that our whole life is offered to your will. 2 We give our minds to understand your ways; hands, eyes, and voice to serve your great design; heart with the flame of your own love ablaze, till for your glory all our powers combine. 3 Father, whose bounty all creation shows; Christ, by whose willing sacrifice we live; Spirit, from whom all life in fullness flows: to you with grateful hearts ourselves we give."
712,As Those of Old Their Firstfruits Brought,"1 As those of old their firstfruits brought of vineyard, flock, and field to God, the giver of all good, the source of bounteous yield, so we today our firstfruits bring, the wealth of this good land: of farm and market, shop and home, of mind and heart and hand. 2 A world in need now summons us to labor, love, and give, to make our life an offering that all may truly live. The church of Christ is calling us to make the dream come true: a world redeemed by Christ-like love, all life in Christ made new. 3 In gratitude and humble trust we bring our best today, to serve your cause and share your love with all along life’s way. O God who gave yourself to us in Jesus Christ your Son, help us to give ourselves each day until life's work is done."
713,Touch the Earth Lightly,"1 Touch the earth lightly, use the earth gently, nourish the life of the world in our care: gift of great wonder, ours to surrender, trust for the children tomorrow will bear. 2 We who endanger, who create hunger, agents of death for all creatures that live, we who would foster clouds of disaster, God of our planet, forestall and forgive! 3 Let there be greening, birth from the burning, water that blesses and air that is sweet, health in God’s garden, hope in God’s children, regeneration that peace will complete 4 God of all living, God of all loving, God of the seedling, the snow, and the sun, teach us, deflect us, Christ reconnect us, using us gently and making us one."
714,God of the Fertile Fields,"1 God of the fertile fields, shaper of earth that yields our daily bread: forth from your bounteous hand come gifts your love has planned, that all in every land be clothed and fed. 2 We would be stewards true, holding in trust from you all that you give; help us in love to share, teach us like you to care for people everywhere, that all may live. 3 As grows the hidden seed to fruit that serves our need, so your reign grows. Let all our toil be used, no gift of yours abused, no humble task refused your love bestows. 4 God of the countryside, dear to the Christ who died to make us one: we pledge our lives anew in faithful love to you. Guide all we say and do. Your will be done."
715,The Earth Belongs to God Alone,"1 The earth belongs to God alone; hard clay, rich soil, fine sand. Give thanks wherever food is grown on borrowed holy land. 2 The fertile ground through years of toil has cried for Sabbath rest— a time of peace for worn-out soil so land can be refreshed. 3 All life belongs to God alone, in wilderness and fields. From fallow land, or plowed and sown, God gives the good it yields. 4 Till God endows the earth once more with Eden’s state of grace, may we endeavor to restore all land as sacred space."
716,"God, Whose Giving Knows No Ending","1 God, whose giving knows no ending, from your rich and endless store, nature's wonder, Jesus' wisdom, costly cross, grave's shattered door: gifted by you, we turn to you, offering up ourselves in praise; thankful song shall rise forever, gracious donor of our days. 2 Skills and time are ours for pressing toward the goals of Christ, your Son: all at peace in health and freedom, races joined, the church made one. Now direct our daily labor, lest we strive for self alone. Born with talents, make us servants fit to answer at your throne. 3 Treasure, too, you have entrusted, gain through powers your grace conferred: ours to use for home and kindred, and to spread the gospel word. Open wide our hands in sharing, as we heed Christ's ageless call, healing, teaching, and reclaiming, serving you by loving all."

718,"Take Up Your Cross, the Savior Said","1 Take up your cross, the Savior said, if you would my disciple be; take up your cross with willing heart, and humbly follow after me. 2 Take up your cross; let not its weight fill your weak spirit with alarm; Christ's strength shall bear your spirit up and brace your heart and nerve your arm. 3 Take up your cross; heed not the shame, and let your foolish pride be still; the Lord for you accepted death upon a cross, on Calvary's hill. 4 Take up your cross, then, in Christ's strength, and calmly every danger brave: it guides you to abundant life and leads to victory o'er the grave."
719,"Come, Labor On","1 Come, labor on. Who dares stand idle on the harvest plain while all around us waves the golden grain? And to each servant does the Master say, ""Go work today."" 2 Come, labor on. Claim the high calling angels cannot share; to young and old the gospel gladness bear. Redeem the time; its hours too swiftly fly. The night draws nigh. 3 Come, labor on. Cast off all gloomy doubt and faithless fear! No arm so weak but may do service here. Though feeble agents, may we all fulfill God's righteous will. 4 Come, labor on. No time for rest, till glows the western sky, till the long shadows o'er our pathway lie, and a glad sound comes with the setting sun, ""Well done, well done!"""
720,Jesus Calls Us,"1 Jesus calls us: o'er the tumult of our life's wild, restless sea; day by day his sweet voice soundeth saying, ""Christian, follow me.” 2 Jesus calls us from the worship of the vain world's golden store, from each idol that would keep us, saying, ""Christian, love me more."" 3 In our joys and in our sorrows, days of toil and hours of ease, still he calls, in cares and pleasures, ""Christian, love me more than these."" 4 Jesus calls us: by thy mercies, Savior, may we hear thy call, give our hearts to thy obedience, serve and love thee best of all."
721,"Lord, You Have Come to the Lakeshore","1 Lord, you have come to the lakeshore looking neither for wealthy nor wise ones; you only asked me to follow humbly. Refrain O Lord, with your eyes you have searched me, and while smiling have spoken my name; now my boat’s left on the shoreline behind me. By your side I will seek other seas. 2 You know so well my possesions; my boat carries no gold and no weapons; you will find there my nets and labor.	(Refrain) 3 You need my hands, full of caring, through my labors to give others rest and constant love that keeps on loving. 	(Refrain) 4 You, who have fished other oceans, ever longed for by souls who are waiting, my loving friend, as thus you call me: 	(Refrain) Spanish 1 Tú has venido a la orilla, no has buscado ni a sabios, ni a ricos, tan sólo quieres que yo te siga.	(Estribillo) Estribillo Señor, me has mirado a los ojos, sonriendo has dicho me nombre, en la arena he dejado mi barca, junto a ti buscaré otro mar. 2 Tú sabes bien lo que tengo: en mi barca no hay oro ni espadas, tan solo redes y mi trabajo.	(Estribillo) 3 Tú necesitas mis manos, mi cansancio que a otros descanse, amor que quiera seguir amando.	(Estribillo) 4 Tú, pescador de otros lagos, ansia eterna de almas que esperan, amigo bueno, que así me llamas.	(Estribillo)"
722,"Lord, Speak to Me, That I May Speak","1 Lord, speak to me that I may speak in living echoes of your tone. As you have sought, so let me seek your erring children lost and lone. 2 O lead me, Lord, that I may lead the wandering and the wavering feet. O feed me, Lord, that I may feed your hungering ones with manna sweet. 3 O teach me, Lord, that I may teach the precious truths which you impart. And wing my words that they may reach the hidden depths of many a heart. 4 O fill me with your fullness, Lord, until my very heart o'erflow in kindling thought and glowing word, your love to tell, your praise to show. 5 O use me, Lord, use even me, just as you will, and when, and where until your blessed face I see, your rest, your joy, your glory share."
723,"Lord, Speak for Me, for I Am Yours","1 Lord, speak for me, for I am yours, and test my mind and heart. I walk with steady trust in you, nor from your ways depart. 2 I do not sit with those who cheat, the false who love pretense. I do not follow where they go, nor count them as my friends. 3 I wash my hands in innocence and seek your altar, Lord, and, singing there with thankful voice, your mighty works record. 4 I love your house, O mighty Lord; I love the holy place where you in your great glory dwell; you visit us in grace. 5 I walk in my integrity; redeem me, Lord, in grace. Securely now I stand, O Lord; in worship I bring praise."
724,"O Jesus, I Have Promised","1 O Jesus, I have promised to serve thee to the end; be thou forever near me, my Master and my friend; I shall not fear the battle if thou art by my side, nor wander from the pathway if thou wilt be my guide. 2 O let me feel thee near me! The world is ever near: I see the sights that dazzle; the tempting sounds I hear. My foes are ever near me, around me and within; but, Jesus, draw thou nearer and shield my soul from sin. 3 O let me hear thee speaking in accents clear and still, above the storms of passion, the murmurs of self-will; O speak to reassure me, to hasten or control; O speak, and make me listen, thou guardian of my soul. 4 O Jesus, thou hast promised to all who follow thee that where thou art in glory there shall thy servant be. And, Jesus, I have promised to serve thee to the end; O give me grace to follow, my Master and my friend."

My foes are ever near me, around me and within; but, Jesus, draw still nearer and shield my soul from sin. 3 O let me hear you speaking in accents clear and still, above the storms of passion, the murmurs of self-will; O speak to reassure me, to hasten or control; O speak, and make me listen, true guardian of my soul. 4 O Jesus, you have promised to all who follow you that where you are in glory your servant shall be too. And, Jesus, I have promised to serve you to the end; now give me grace to follow, my Master and my friend."
726,Will You Come and Follow Me,"1 “Will you come and follow me if I but call your name? Will you go where you don’t know and never be the same? Will you let my love be shown; will you let my name be known; will you let my life be grown in you and you in me?” 2 “Will you leave yourself behind if I but call your name? Will you care for cruel and kind and never be the same? Will you risk the hostile stare should your life attract or scare? Will you let me answer prayer in you and you in me?” 3 “Will you let the blinded see if I but call your name? Will you set the prisoners free and never be the same? Will you kiss the leper clean, and do such as this unseen, and admit to what I mean in you and you in me?” 4 “Will you love the ‘you’ you hide if I but call your name? Will you quell the fear inside and never be the same? Will you use the faith you’ve found to reshape the world around, through my sight and touch and sound in you and you in me?” 5 Lord, your summons echoes true when you but call my name. Let me turn and follow you and never be the same. In your company I’ll go where your love and footsteps show. Thus I’ll move and live and grow in you and you in me."
727,Will You Let Me Be Your Servant,"1 Will you let me be your servant, let me be as Christ to you? Pray that I may have the grace to let you be my servant too. 2 We are pilgrims on a journey; we’re together on the road. We are here to help each other walk the mile and bear the load. 3 I will hold the Christ-light for you in the nighttime of your fear. I will hold my hand out to you, speak the peace you long to hear. 4 I will weep when you are weeping; when you laugh I’ll laugh with you. I will share your joy and sorrow till we’ve seen this journey through. 5 When we sing to God in heaven, we shall find such harmony, born of all we’ve known together of Christ’s love and agony. 6 Will you let me be your servant, let me be as Christ to you? Pray that I may have the grace to let you be my servant too."
728,Somebody's Knocking at Your Door,"Somebody’s knocking at your door; somebody’s knocking at your door; O sinner, why don’t you answer? Somebody’s knocking at your door. 1 Knocks like Jesus. Somebody’s knocking at your door. Knocks like Jesus. Somebody’s knocking at your door. O sinner, why don’t you answer? Somebody’s knocking at your door. 2 Can’t you hear him? Somebody’s knocking at your door. Can’t you hear him? Somebody’s knocking at your door. O sinner, why don’t you answer? Somebody’s knocking at your door. 3 Answer Jesus.

729,"Lord, I Want to Be a Christian","1 Lord, I want to be a Christian in my heart, in my heart; Lord, I want to be a Christian in my heart. In my heart, in my heart, Lord, I want to be a Christian in my heart. 2 Lord, I want to be more loving in my heart, in my heart; Lord, I want to be more loving in my heart.

730,I Sing a Song of the Saints of God,"1 I sing a song of the saints of God, patient and brave and true, who toiled and fought and lived and died for the Lord they loved and knew. And one was a doctor, and one was a queen, and one was a shepherdess on the green: they were all of them saints of God, and I mean, God helping, to be one too. 2 They loved their Lord so dear, so dear, and God’s love made them strong; and they followed the right, for Jesus’ sake, the whole of their good lives long. And one was a soldier, and one was a priest, and one was slain by a fierce wild beast: and there’s not any reason, no, not the least, why I shouldn’t be one too. 3 They lived not only in ages past; there are hundreds of thousands still; the world is bright with the joyous saints who love to do Jesus’ will. You can meet them in school, or in lanes, or at sea, in church, or in trains, or in shops, or at tea; for the saints of God are just folk like me, and I mean to be one too."
731,Give Thanks for Those Whose Faith Is Firm,"1 Give thanks for those whose faith is firm when all around seems bleak: on God’s good promise they rely, so while they live and when they die how forcefully they speak: the strong, who once were weak! 2 Give thanks for those whose hope is clear, beyond mere mortal sight: who seek the city God has planned, the true, eternal promised land, and steer on toward that light, a beacon ever bright. 3 Give thanks for those whose love is pure, a sparkling precious stone: they show by what they say and do an inward beauty, warm and true, for God’s concerns they own: God’s love through them is known. 4 Give thanks for saints of ages past and saints alive today: though often by this world despised, their hearts by God are richly prized. Give thanks that we may say we share their pilgrim way."
732,Rejoice in God's Saints,"1 Rejoice in God's saints, today and all days! A world without saints forgets how to praise. Their faith in acquiring the habit of prayer, their depth of adoring, Lord, help us to share. 2 Some march with events to turn them God's way; some need to withdraw, the better to pray; some carry the gospel through fire and through flood: our world is their parish; their purpose is God. 3 Rejoice in those saints, unpraised and unknown, who bear someone's cross, or shoulder their own; they share our complaining, our comforts, our cares: what patience in caring, what courage, is theirs! 4 Rejoice in God's saints, today and all days! A world without saints forgets how to praise. In loving, in living, they prove it is true: their way of self-giving, Lord, leads us to you."
733,We All Are One in Mission,"1 We all are one in mission; we all are one in call, our varied gifts united by Christ, the Lord of all. A single, great commission compels us from above to plan and work together that all may know Christ’s love. 2 We all are called for service to witness in God’s name. Our ministries are different; our purpose is the same: to touch the lives of others by God’s surprising grace, so every folk and nation may feel God’s warm embrace. 3 Now let us be united and let our song be heard. Now let us be a vessel for God’s redeeming word. We all are one in mission; we all are one in call, our varied gifts united by Christ, the Lord of all."
734,Hope of the World,"1 Hope of the world, thou Christ of great compassion: speak to our fearful hearts by conflict rent; save us, thy people, from consuming passion, who by our own false hopes and aims are spent. 2 Hope of the world, God’s gift from highest heaven, bringing to hungry souls the bread of life: still let thy Spirit unto us be given to heal earth’s wounds and end our bitter strife. 3 Hope of the world, afoot on dusty highways, showing to wandering souls the path of light: walk thou beside us lest the tempting byways lure us away from thee to endless night. 4 Hope of the world, who by thy cross didst save us from death and deep despair, from sin and guilt: we render back the love thy mercy gave us; take thou our lives and use them as thou wilt. 5 Hope of the world, O Christ, o’er death victorious, who by this sign didst conquer grief and pain: we would be faithful to thy gospel glorious; thou art our Lord! Thou dost forever reign!"
735,I Need Thee Every Hour,"1 I need thee every hour, most gracious Lord; no tender voice like thine can peace afford. Refrain: I need thee, O I need thee, every hour I need thee!

736,I Want to Be as Close to You,"1 I want to be as close to you as she who gave you birth. Christ Jesus, let my ""yes,"" like hers, bring blessings on our earth. 2 I want to be as close to you as was beloved John. Christ, let me follow where you lead, by trust and friendship drawn. 3 I want to be as close to you as Magdalene who went, proclaiming news of death's defeat, your first apostle sent. 4 You want to be as close to me as mother, brother, friend. Christ, keep me faithful to your love, a love that has no end. 5 Like Mary, John, and Magdalene, make us disciples true. Like mother, brother, sister, friend, Christ, keep us close to you."
737,"Lord Jesus, You Shall Be My Song","1 Lord Jesus, you shall be my song as I journey; I’ll tell everybody about you wherever I go: you alone are our life and our peace and our love. Lord Jesus, you shall be my song as I journey. 2 Lord Jesus, I’ll praise you as long as I journey. May all of my joy be a faithful reflection of you. May the earth and the sea and the sky join my song. Lord Jesus, I’ll praise you as long as I journey. 3 As long as I live, Jesus, make me your servant, to carry your cross and to share all your burdens and tears. For you saved me by giving your body and blood. As long as I live, Jesus, make me your servant. 4 I fear in the dark and the doubt of my journey; but courage will come with the sound of your steps by my side. And with all of the family you saved by your love, we’ll sing to your dawn at the end of our journey. French: 1 Jésus, je voudrais te chanter sur ma route; Jésus, je voudrais t'annoncer à mes voisins partout, car toi seul es la vie et la paix et l'amour: Jésus, je voudrais te chanter sur ma route. 2 Jésus, je voudrais te louer sur ma route; Jésus, je voudrais que ma voix soit l'écho de ta joie, et que chante la terre et que chante le ciel; Jésus, je voudrais te louer sur ma route. 3 Jésus, je voudrais te servir sur ma route; Jésus, je voudrais partager les souffrances de ta croix, car tu livres pour moi et ton corps et ton sang; Jésus, je voudrais te servir sur ma route. 4 Jésus, je voudrais tout au long de ma route entendre tes pas résonner dans la nuit près de moi, jusqu'à l'aube du jour où ton peuple sauvé, Jésus, chantera ton retour sur ma route."
738,"O Master, Let Me Walk with Thee","1 O Master, let me walk with thee in lowly paths of service free; tell me thy secret; help me bear the strain of toil, the fret of care. 2 Help me the slow of heart to move by some clear, winning word of love; teach me the wayward feet to stay, and guide them in the homeward way. 3 Teach me thy patience, still with thee in closer, dearer company, in work that keeps faith sweet and strong, in trust that triumphs over wrong. 4 In hope that sends a shining ray far down the future's broadening way; in peace that only thou canst give, with thee, O Master, let me live."
739,O for a Closer Walk with God,"1 O for a closer walk with God, a calm and heavenly frame, a light to shine upon the road that leads me to the Lamb! 2 Return, O holy Dove, return, sweet messenger of rest! I hate the sins that made thee mourn and drove thee from my breast. 3 The dearest idol I have known, whate'er that idol be, help me to tear it from thy throne, and worship only thee. 4 So shall my walk be close with God, calm and serene my frame; so purer light shall mark the road that leads me to the Lamb."
740,"Lead Me, Guide Me","Refrain: Lead me, guide me, along the way, for if you lead me, I cannot stray. Lord, let me walk each day with thee. Lead me, O Lord, lead me. I am weak and I need your strength and power to help me over my weakest hour. Help me through the darkness your face to see. Lead me, O Lord, lead me.    (Refrain)"
741,Guide My Feet,"1 Guide my feet while I run this race; (yes, my Lord!) guide my feet while I run this race; (yes, my Lord!) guide my feet while I run this race, for I don’t want to run this race in vain!

743,"O God, You Are My God","O God, you are my God, and I will ever praise you. O God, you are my God, and I will ever praise you. I will seek you in the morning, and I will learn to walk in your ways. And step by step you’ll lead me, and I will follow you all of my days."
744,"Arise, Your Light Is Come!","1 Arise, your light is come! The Spirit's call obey; show forth the glory of your God, which shines on you today. 2 Arise, your light is come! Fling wide the prison door; proclaim the captives' liberty, good tidings to the poor. 3 Arise, your light is come! All you in sorrow born, bind up the brokenhearted ones and comfort those who mourn. 4 Arise, your light is come! The mountains burst in song! Rise up like eagles on the wing; God's power will make us strong."

The Lord now sends us forth with hands to serve and give, to make of all the earth a better place to live. The angels are not sent into our world of pain to do what we were meant to do in Jesus’ name; that falls to you and me and all who are made free. Help us, O Lord, we pray, to do your will today.

751,From the Nets of Our Labor,"1 From the nets of our labors, through the noise and confusion, from the city or seashore, Jesus summons us all.	(Refrain) Refrain: We will rise up and follow, Christ before and beside us, loving pattern to guide us, as we answer the call. 2 When we faint and grow weary from the bearing of burdens, with a message of comfort, Jesus summons us all.

752,Dona Nobis Pacem,"Latin Dona nobis pacem, pacem. Dona nobis pacem. Hebrew Sim shalom, sim shalom, sim shalom. Sim shalom aleinu. Arabic Rabbu habna salamann tamman. Rabbu habna salamann."
753,Make Me a Channel of Your Peace,"1 Make me a channel of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me bring your love. Where there is injury, your pardon, Lord, and where there’s doubt, true faith in you. 2 Make me a channel of your peace. Where there’s despair in life, let me bring hope. Where there is darkness, only light, and where there’s sadness, ever joy. 3 O, Master, grant that I may never seek so much to be consoled as to console, to be understood as to understand, to be loved as to love with all my soul. 4 Make me a channel of your peace. It is in pardoning that we are pardoned, in giving of ourselves that we receive, and in dying that we’re born to eternal life."
754,Help Us Accept Each Other,"1 Help us accept each other as Christ accepted us; teach us as sister, brother, each person to embrace. Be present, Lord, among us and bring us to believe we are ourselves accepted, and meant to love and live. 2 Teach us, O Lord, your lessons, as in our daily life we struggle to be human and search for hope and faith. Teach us to care for people, for all, not just for some, to love them as we find them, or as they may become. 3 Let your acceptance change us, so that we may be moved in living situations to do the truth in love; to practice your acceptance until we know by heart the table of forgiveness, and laughter’s healing art. 4 Lord, for today’s encounters with all who are in need, who hunger for acceptance, for justice and for bread, we need new eyes for seeing, new hands for holding on: renew us with your Spirit; Lord, free us; make us one!"
755,Alleluia! Laud and Blessing,"1 Alleluia! Laud and blessing to our God, whose Word is sure; by whose grace we find redemption, in whose love we live secure. Righteousness and rich compassion shall attend us all our days; may God’s promise to be faithful echo through our songs of praise! 2 Alleluia! God sustains us; matchless are the gifts we share: light in darkness, hope in conflict, answers to our deepest prayer. Ours to give as we are given: arms to lift when others fall; images of God’s great goodness, faithful servants to God’s call. 3 Alleluia! Holy Parent, all your children now reclaim; may our lives reflect your justice, heirs to your most sacred name. Fill our hearts with understanding, brace our weakness by your might; awesome honor, born in wisdom; your great glory, our delight!"

Where hate and fear divide us and bitter threats are hurled, in love and mercy guide us and heal our strife-torn world. 2 From search for wealth and power and scorn of truth and right, from trust in bombs that shower destruction through the night, from pride of race and station and blindness to your way, deliver every nation, eternal God, we pray. 3 Lord, strengthen those who labor that all may find release from fear of rattling saber, from dread of war's increase; when hope and courage falter, your still small voice be heard; with faith that none can alter, your servants undergird. 4 Keep bright in us the vision of days when war shall cease, when hatred and division give way to love and peace, till dawns the morning glorious when truth and justice reign and Christ shall rule victorious o'er all the world's domain."
757,Today We All Are Called to Be Disciples,"1 Today we all are called to be disciples of the Lord, to help to set the captive free, make plowshare out of sword, to feed the hungry, quench their thirst, make love and peace our fast, to serve the poor and homeless first, our ease and comfort last. 2 God made the world and at its birth ordained our human race to live as stewards of the earth, responding to God's grace. But we are vain and sadly proud; we sow not peace but strife. Our discord spreads a deadly cloud that threatens all of life. 3 Pray justice may come rolling down as in a mighty stream, with righteousness in field and town to cleanse us and redeem. For God is longing to restore an earth where conflicts cease, a world that was created for a harmony of peace. 4 May we in service to our God act out the living word, and walk the road the saints have trod till all have seen and heard. As stewards of the earth may we give thanks in one accord to God who calls us all to be disciples of the Lord."
758,Why Do Nations Rage Together,"1 Why do nations rage together; why in vain do they conspire? Rulers of earth’s vast dominions light the skies with martyrs’ fire. Truth mistaken, God forsaken, banes of righteousness arise; yet shall they reap sore displeasure, sure defeat before God’s eyes. 2 To the children of the promise God shall give the throne this day. With a scepter forged of iron, they shall dash their foes as clay: faith revealing, humbly kneeling, quench the fire and sheathe the sword, for God’s wrath is quickly kindled; blest are they who serve the Lord."
759,"O God, We Bear the Imprint of Your Face","1 O God, we bear the imprint of your face: the colors of our skin are your design, and what we have of beauty in our race as man or woman, you alone define, who stretched a living fabric on our frame and gave to each a language and a name. 2 Where we are torn and pulled apart by hate because our race, our skin is not the same, while we are judged unequal by the state and victims made because we own our name, humanity reduced to little worth, dishonored is your living face on earth. 3 O God, we share the image of the One whose flesh and blood are ours, whatever skin; in Christ’s humanity we find our own, and in his family our proper kin: Christ is the brother we still crucify, his love the language we must learn, or die."
760,Bring Many Names,"1 Bring many names, beautiful and good, celebrate, in parable and story, holiness in glory, living, loving God. Hail and Hosanna! Bring many names! 2 Strong mother God, working night and day, planning all the wonders of creation, setting each equation genius at play: Hail and Hosanna, strong mother God! 3 Warm father God, hugging every child, feeling all the strains of human living, caring and forgiving till we're reconciled: Hail and Hosanna, warm father God! 4 Old, aching God, gray with endless care, calmly piercing evil's new disguises, glad of good surprises, wiser than despair: Hail and Hosanna, old, aching God! 5 Young, growing God, eager, on the move, saying no to falsehood and unkindness, crying out for justice, giving all you have: Hail and Hosanna, young, growing God! 6 Great, living God, never fully known, joyful darkness far beyond our seeing, closer yet than breathing, everlasting home: Hail and Hosanna, great, living God!"
761,Called as Partners in Christ's Service,"1 Called as partners in Christ’s service, called to ministries of grace, we respond with deep commitment fresh new lines of faith to trace. May we learn the art of sharing, side by side and friend with friend, equal partners in our caring to fulfill God’s chosen end. 2 Christ’s example, Christ’s inspiring, Christ’s clear call to work and worth, let us follow, never faltering, reconciling folk on earth. Men and women, richer, poorer, all God’s people, young and old, blending human skills together gracious gifts from God unfold. 3 Thus new patterns for Christ’s mission, in a small or global sense, help us bear each other’s burdens, breaking down each wall or fence. Words of comfort, words of vision, words of challenge, said with care, bring new power and strength for action, make us colleagues, free and fair. 4 So God grant us for tomorrow ways to order human life that surround each person’s sorrow with a calm that conquers strife. Make us partners in our living, our compassion to increase, messengers of faith, thus giving hope and confidence and peace."
762,When the Poor Ones,"1 When the poor ones who have nothing share with strangers, when the thirsty water give unto us all, when the crippled in their weakness strengthen others, Refrain: then we know that God still goes that road with us, then we know that God still goes that road with us. 2 When at last all those who suffer find their comfort, when they hope though even hope seems hopelessness, when we love though hate at times seems all around us,	(Refrain) 3 When our joy fills up our cup to overflowing, when our lips can speak no words other than true, when we know that love for simple things is better, 	(Refrain) 4 When our homes are filled with goodness in abundance, when we learn how to make peace instead of war, when each stranger that we meet is called a neighbor, 	(Refrain) Spanish 1 Cuando el pobre nada tiene y aún reparte, cuando un hombre pasa sed y agua nos da, cuando el débil a su hermano fortalece, Estribillo: va Dios mismo en nuestro mismo caminar. Va Dios mismo en nuestro mismo caminar. 2 Cuando un hombre sufre y logra su consuelo, cuando espera y no se cansa de esperar, cuando amamos, aunque el odio nos rodée,	(Estribillo) 3 Cuando crece la alegría y nos inunda, cuando dicen nuestros labios la verdad, cuando amamos el sentir de los sencillos, 	(Estribillo) 4 Cuando abunda el bien y llena los hogares, cuando un hombre donde hay guerra pone paz, cuando “hermano” le llamamos al extraño, 	(Estribillo)"
763,The Lord Hears the Cry of the Poor,"The Lord hears the cry of the poor. Blessed be the Lord. Psalm 82 (Refrain) 1 God arises in the council of heaven and gives judgment in the midst of the gods: 2 “How long will you judge unjustly, and show favor to the wicked? 3 Save the weak and the orphan; defend the humble and needy; 4 rescue the weak and the poor; deliver them from the power of the wicked.	(Refrain) 5 They do not know, neither do they understand; they go about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken. 6 Now I say to you, ‘You are gods, and all of you children of the Most high; 7 nevertheless, you shall die like mortals, and fall like any leader.’” 8 Arise, O God, and rule the earth, for you shall take all nations for your own.	(Refrain)"

766,The Church of Christ Cannot Be Bound,"1 The church of Christ cannot be bound by walls of wood or stone. Where charity and love are found there can the church be known. 2 True faith will open up the door and step into the street. True service will seek out the poor and ask to wash their feet. 3 True love will not sit idly by when justice is denied. True mercy hears the homeless cry and welcomes them inside. 4 If what we have we freely share to meet our neighbor's need, then we extend the Spirit's care through every selfless deed. 5 The church of Christ cannot be bound by walls of wood or stone. Where charity and love are found, there can the church be known."
767,Together We Serve,"1 Together we serve, united by love, inviting God’s world to the glorious feast. We work and we pray through sorrow and joy, extending God’s love to the last and the least. 2 We seek to become a beacon of hope, a lamp for the heart and a light for the feet. We learn, year by year, to let love shine through until we see Christ in each person we meet. 3 We welcome the scarred, the wealthy, the poor, the busy, the lonely, and all who need care. We offer a home to those who will come, our hands quick to help, our hearts ready to dare. 4 Together, by grace, we witness and work, remembering Jesus, in whom we grow strong. Together we serve in Spirit and truth, remembering love is the strength of our song."

770,I'm Gonna Eat at the Welcome Table,"1 I’m gonna eat at the welcome table; I’m gonna eat at the welcome table, Alleluia. I’m gonna eat at the welcome table; I’m gonna eat at the welcome table, Alleluia. 2 I’m gonna eat and drink with my Jesus; . . . 3 I’m gonna join with sisters, brothers; . . . 4 Here all the world will find a welcome; . . . 5 We’re gonna feast on milk and honey; . . ."
771,What Is the World Like,"1 What is the world like when God's will is done? Mustard seeds grow more than we can conceive: roots thread the soil; branches reach for the sun. This is how God moves us each to believe. 2 What is the world like when God's will is done? Witness the wandering child coming home; watch as the parent breaks into a run. This is how God longs for us when we roam. 3 What is the world like when God's will is done? No more is neighbor just ally or friend; peace thrives in places where once there was none. This is how God works when rivalries end. 4 What is the world like when God's will is done? Ready for feasting, we watch through the night, tending our lamps till the new day's begun. This is how God readies us for the light. 5 These are the stories that Jesus imparts, filled with the Spirit who joins us as one. Born through our voices, our hands, and our hearts, this is a new world where God's will is done."
772,Live into Hope,"1 Live into hope of captives freed, of sight regained, the end of greed. The oppressed shall be the first to see the year of God's own jubilee! 2 Live into hope! The blind shall see with insight and with clarity, removing shades of pride and fear, a vision of our God brought near. 3 Live into hope of liberty, the right to speak, the right to be, the right to have one's daily bread, to hear God's word and thus be fed. 4 Live into hope of captives freed from chains of fear or want or greed. God now proclaims our full release to faith and hope and joy and peace."
773,Heaven Shall Not Wait,"1 Heaven shall not wait for the poor to lose their patience, the scorned to smile, the despised to find a friend: Jesus is Lord; he has championed the unwanted; in him injustice confronts its timely end. 2 Heaven shall not wait for the rich to share their fortunes, the proud to fall, the elite to tend the least: Jesus is Lord; he has shown the master's privilege: to kneel and wash servants' feet before they feast. 3 Heaven shall not wait for the dawn of great ideas, thoughts of compassion divorced from cries of pain: Jesus is Lord; he has married word and action; his cross and company make his purpose plain. 4 Heaven shall not wait for triumphant Hallelujahs, when earth has passed and we reach another shore: Jesus is Lord in our present imperfection; his power and love are for now and then for evermore."
774,There Is Now a New Creation,"1 There is now a new creation through the grace of Jesus Christ, peace and reconciliation with the God of endless life. 2 Call the lost and found together; tell the news to everyone: now the past is gone forever and a new life has begun. 3 Wrap the prodigal in welcome; run to greet the wayward child. All is finished and forgiven; let us now be reconciled. 4 Come and join the celebration; come and join this happy feast; Jesus makes an invitation to the greatest and the least. 5 There is now a new creation through the grace of Jesus Christ. Sing, with thanks and adoration, to the God of endless life!"
775,I Want Jesus to Walk with Me,"1 I want Jesus to walk with me; I want Jesus to walk with me; all along my pilgrim journey, Lord, I want Jesus to walk with me. 2 In my trials, Lord, walk with me; in my trials, Lord, walk with me; when my heart is almost breaking, Lord, I want Jesus to walk with me. 3 When I’m in trouble, Lord, walk with me; when I’m in trouble, Lord, walk with me; when my head is bowed in sorrow, Lord, I want Jesus to walk with me."
776,"O God, Be Gracious","1 O God, be gracious; hear my prayer, and answer when I cry. You give me hope in my distress; you will not pass me by. 2 How long, O God, will liars boast while I am smeared with shame? Come, set your faithful servant free; I call upon your name! 3 When terror wakes me from my dreams and shakes me through and through, teach me to pray with confidence and put my trust in you. 4 Some fear that you will not provide; they cry, “Show us your face!” But you have satisfied my heart with goodness, joy, and grace. 5 Now lay me down to sleep in peace; in safety let me rest. O God, within your loving care I am forever blessed."
777,"How Long, O Lord","How Long, O Lord (Psalm 13) 1 How long, O Lord, will you forget an answer to my prayer? No tokens of your love I see; your face is turned away from me; I wrestle with despair! 2 How long, O Lord, will you forsake and leave me in this way? When will you come to my relief? My heart is overwhelmed with grief, by evil night and day! 3 How long, O Lord?  But you forgive with mercy from above. I find that all your ways are just; I learn to praise you and to trust in your unfailing love!"
778,As Pants the Deer for Living Streams,"1 As pants the deer for living streams, in dry or desert space, I thirst for you, O living God; I long to see your face! O how I miss the happy days when with the throng I'd praise! Refrain: Take courage now, my trembling heart, for God will take your part! 2 Tears are my bread both night and day; fools crush me, soul and bone. They laugh and ask, ""Where is your God?"" I hope in you alone. Why cast me off?  Where have you gone? Why is your grace withdrawn?	(Refrain) 3 Deep calls to deep, the billows roar; they cover me with pain. I cry for healing and for home; God, show your love again! Without your people, who am I? Without you I will die. 	(Refrain) 4 O send your light to guide me home; my Savior, guide me still. With shouting pilgrims I will come to climb your holy hill. Then with the harp I'll sing your praise; my happy voice I'll raise. 	(Refrain)"
779,"How Long, O God, Will My Prayers Be in Vain?","1 How long, O God, will my prayers be in vain? Why must I languish in sorrow and pain? Do not abandon a child you have made; you are my shelter, my solace and shade. 2 When evil prospers and hope is long gone, do not forsake me, your presence withdrawn. Shield and protect those who call on your name; you are my God, and your blessing I claim. 3 Early and late will my tongue sing your praise; you will uphold me the length of my days. You are a stronghold for all the oppressed; hear us, O God! Let your people be blessed."
780,"Come Quickly, Lord, to Rescue Me","1 Come quickly, Lord, to rescue me, and hasten to my help, I pray. May all who seek to take my life be put to shame without delay. 2 May all who seek your name rejoice, your praise in gratitude record. May those who love your saving power say evermore, “Exalt the Lord!” 3 Yet I am poor and needy, Lord; be quick to hear my urgent plea. You are my help, my Savior God! Do not delay; remember me."
781,"Hear My Cry, O God, and Save Me!","1 Hear my cry, O God, and save me! Troubles and distress enslave me. Day and night I seek your face, yearning for your light and grace. But these eyes: they cannot see you; outstretched arms: they cannot feel you. My heart breaks in deep despair; my soul longs to hold you here. 2 You, O God, once walked beside me. In the night your songs revived me. Were your promises in vain? Will you smile on me again? Long ago you brought redemption; your right hand won our salvation. I remember deeds of old: now, remember me, O Lord! 3 All creation bows before you; saints in earth and heaven adore you. Thunder roars and torrents fall at your word, O God of all! In our grief, you stand beside us, there to lift us, and to guide us, unseen savior of our days, heir to endless songs of praise!"
782,"Hear My Prayer, O God","1 Hear my prayer, O God, and listen to my plea; faithful, righteous One, give ear and answer me. Judge me not, I pray; no merit dare I claim; knowing my own faults, I trust in your just Name. 2 Hounded by a foe who crushed me to the ground, I am like the dead or those in prison bound. Hopeless, numbed by fear, I ponder all your care; thirsty as parched earth, I lift my hands in prayer. 3 Answer soon, O God; my spirit faints in me; do not hide your face, or I will cease to be. When the morning dawns, make known your love anew; show me how to walk, for I will trust in you. 4 Keep me safe, O God, and help me learn your will; let your Spirit lead through level pathways still. For your great Name’s sake, my griefs and fears dispel; free me from my foes, that I may serve you well."
783,When We Are Tested,"1 When we are tested and wrestle alone, famished for bread when the world offers stone, nourish us, God, by your word and your way, food that sustains us by night and by day. 2 When in the desert we cry for relief, pleading for paths marked by certain belief, lift us to love you beyond sign and test, trusting your presence, our only true rest. 3 When we are tempted to barter our souls, trading the truth for the power to control, teach us to worship and praise only you, seeking your will in the work that we do. 4 When we have struggled and searched through the night, sorting and sifting the wrong from the right, Savior, surround us with circles of care, angels of healing, of hope, and of prayer."
784,By the Waters of Babylon,"By the waters, the waters of Babylon, we sat down and wept, and wept for Zion. We remember, we remember, we remember Zion."
785,In Deepest Night,"1 In deepest night, in darkest days, when harps are hung, no songs we raise, when silence must suffice as praise, yet sounding in us quietly there is the song of God. 2 When friend was lost, when love deceived, dear Jesus wept, God was bereaved; so with us in our grief God grieves, and round about us mournfully there are the tears of God. 3 When through the waters winds our path, around us pain, around us death, deep calls to deep, a saving breath, and found beside us faithfully there is the love of God."
786,"Why Stand So Far Away, My God?","1 Why stand so far away, my God? Why hide in times of need? The proud, unbridled, chase the poor, and curse you in their greed. 2 Why do you hide when, full of lies, they murder and betray? They wait to pounce upon the weak as lions stalk their prey. 3 The weak are crushed and fall to earth; the wicked strut and preen. Why in these cruel, chaotic times cannot your face be seen? 4 In ages past you heard the voice of those the proud oppress. Remember those who suffer now, who cry in deep distress. 5 Arise, O God, and lift your hand; bring justice to the poor. Come, help us stop the flow of blood! Let terror reign no more!"
787,God Weeps with Us Who Weep and Mourn,"1 God weeps with us who weep and mourn; God’s tears flow down with ours, and God’s own heart is bruised and worn from all the heavy hours of watching while the soul’s bright fire burned lower day by day, and pulse and breath and love’s desire dimmed down to ash and clay. 2 Through tears and sorrow, God, we share a sense of your vast grief: the weight of bearing every prayer for healing and relief, the burden of our questions why, the doubts that they engage, and as our friends and loved ones die, our hopelessness and rage. 3 And yet because, like us, you weep, we trust you will receive and in your tender heart will keep the ones for whom we grieve, while with your tears our hearts will taste the deep, dear core of things from which both life and death are graced by love’s renewing springs."
788,"To You, O Lord, We Lift Our Eyes","1 To you, O Lord, we lift our eyes, to you enthroned in heaven above; as servants wait for those they serve, so we look up and wait God’s love. 2 Have mercy on us now, O Lord; contempt has been our lot too long. Too long have we been mocked and scorned, derided by the proud and strong."
789,"Jesus, Savior, Lord, Now to You I Come","Refrain: Jesus, Savior, Lord, now to you I come. Saranam, saranam, saranam. You’re my rock, my refuge, my heavenly home. Saranam, saranam, saranam. 1 From the earth wherever I may be, out of desperation and through agony, I cry in helplessness: O answer me. Saranam, saranam, saranam.	(Refrain) 2 In your heart give me a hiding place, and beneath your wings let me find sheltering grace; O let me see the sunshine of your face. Saranam, saranam, saranam. 	(Refrain) 3 Then with joy to you my vows I'll pay, and give thanks for all your mercy every day. I'll humbly follow in your perfect way. Saranam, saranam, saranam. 	(Refrain)"
790,In Silence My Soul Thirsts,"1 In silence my soul thirsts for God; for God alone I wait. My enemies may chase me down; love shields me from their hate. Refrain: God is my rock; God is my strength; God is my salvation, my refuge, my abiding peace. I shall not be shaken. 2 In stillness I pour out my fears; the solitude builds trust. My refuge rests in God’s great grace. My anxious thoughts are hushed.	(Refrain) 3 In quietness my Lord conferred two truths I now declare: no greater love than God’s is known; no power can compare.	(Refrain)"
791,"For You, My God, I Wait","1 For you, my God, I wait with hope born of the Word. Like sleepless ones who long to dream I wait and call my Lord. 2 Lord, hear my pleading voice, and let me know you hear! As sleepless ones feel rest approach, I know my God is near. 3 If you should list my faults, the sins of heart and hand, like sleepless ones who groan at dawn I know I could not stand! 4 For even from the deep I know you hear my cries. Like sleepless ones who dream at last, I ease my weary eyes. 5 And once my soul is still, in you I find my rest, at peace as though a child upon a gentle mother’s breast. 6 O God, you are my hope; I know that you forgive. Your love redeems me from the depths so I may rise and live."
792,There Is a Balm in Gilead,"Refrain: There is a balm in Gilead to make the wounded whole; there is a balm in Gilead to heal the sin-sick soul. 1 Sometimes I feel discouraged, and think my work’s in vain, but then the Holy Spirit revives my soul again.	(Refrain) 2 Don’t ever feel discouraged, for Jesus is your friend, and if you lack for knowledge, he’ll not refuse to lend.	(Refrain) 3 If you cannot preach like Peter, if you cannot pray like Paul, you can tell the love of Jesus and say, “He died for all.”	(Refrain)"
793,"O Christ, the Healer","1 O Christ, the healer, we have come to pray for health, to plead for friends. How can we fail to be restored when reached by love that never ends? 2 From every ailment flesh endures our bodies clamor to be freed; yet in our hearts we would confess that wholeness is our deepest need. 3 How strong, O Lord, are our desires, how weak our knowledge of ourselves! Release in us those healing truths unconscious pride resists or shelves. 4 In conflicts that destroy our health we recognize the world’s disease; our common life declares our ills. Is there no cure, O Christ, for these? 5 Grant that we all, made one in faith, in your community may find the wholeness that, enriching us, shall reach the whole of humankind."
794,"O Savior, in This Quiet Place","1 O Savior, in this quiet place, where anyone may kneel, I also come to ask for grace, believing you can heal. 2 If pain of body, stress of mind, destroys my inward peace, in prayer for others may I find the secret of release. 3 If self upon its sickness feeds and turns my life to gall, let me not brood upon my needs, but simply tell you all. 4 You never said “You ask too much” to any troubled soul. I long to feel your healing touch; will you not make me whole? 5 But if the thing I most desire is not your way for me, may faith, when tested in the fire, prove its integrity. 6 Of all my prayers, may this be chief: till faith is fully grown, Lord, disbelieve my unbelief, and claim me as your own."
795,Healer of Our Every Ill,"Refrain: Healer of our every ill, light of each tomorrow, give us peace beyond our fear, and hope beyond our sorrow. 1You who know our fears and sadness, grace us with your peace and gladness; Spirit of all comfort, fill our hearts. 2 In the pain and joy beholding how your grace is still unfolding, give us all your vision, God of love. 3 Give us strength to love each other, every sister, every brother; Spirit of all kindness, be our guide. 4 You who know each thought and feeling, teach us all your way of healing; Spirit of compassion, fill each heart."
796,"We Come to You for Healing, Lord","1 We come to you for healing, Lord, of body, mind, and soul, and pray that by your Spirit’s touch we may again be whole. 2 As once you walked through ancient streets and reached toward those in pain, we know you come among us still with power to heal again. 3 You touch us through physicians’ skills, through nurses’ gifts of care, and through the love of faithful friends who lift our lives in prayer. 4 Through nights of pain and wakefulness, through days when strength runs low, grant us your gift of patience, Lord, your calming peace to know. 5 We come to you, O loving Lord, in our distress and pain, in trust that through our nights and days your grace will heal, sustain."
797,We Cannot Measure How You Heal,"1 We cannot measure how you heal or answer every sufferer’s prayer, yet we believe your grace responds where faith and doubt unite to care. Your hands, though bloodied on the cross, survive to hold and heal and warn, to carry all through death to life and cradle children yet unborn. 2 The pain that will not go away, the guilt that clings from things long past, the fear of what the future holds, are present as if meant to last. But present too is love which tends the hurt we never hoped to find, the private agonies inside, the memories that haunt the mind. 3 So some have come who need your help and some have come to make amends, as hands which shaped and saved the world are present in the touch of friends. Lord, let your Spirit meet us here to mend the body, mind, and soul, to disentangle peace from pain, and make your broken people whole."
798,All with Joyful Exultation,"Refrain: All with joyful exultation let us sing to God our praise; to the rock of our salvation loud hosannas raise. 1 Lord, we sing with joyful voices; your great power can lift and save; by your healing touch, revive us; life restore beyond the grave.	(Refrain) 2 Praise to you, our sure salvation, you, the Holy One above. End the night so dimmed by anguish, with your light of peace and love. 	(Refrain) 3 Change our sorrow to rejoicing; clothe with gladness all despair; cause unsteady feet that stumble now to dance beneath your care. 	(Refrain) 4 Dry our tears we shed in mourning; give us steadfast hope always; fill our hearts with expectation; fill our songs with thanks and praise. 	(Refrain)"
799,"I Love the Lord, Who Heard My Cry","1 I love the Lord, who heard my cry and pitied every groan. Long as I live and troubles rise, I’ll hasten to God’s throne. 2 I love the Lord, who heard my cry and chased my grief away. O let my heart no more despair while I have breath to pray."
800,Sometimes a Light Surprises,"1 Sometime a light surprises the child of God who sings; it is the Lord who rises with healing in his wings; when comforts are declining, he grants the soul again a season of clear shining to cheer it after rain. 2 In holy contemplation we sweetly then pursue the theme of God’s salvation and find it ever new; set free from present sorrow, we cheerfully can say, “Let the unknown tomorrow bring with it what it may.” 3 It can bring with it nothing but he will bear us through; who gives the lilies clothing will clothe his people, too; beneath the spreading heavens no creature but is fed; and he who feeds the ravens will give his children bread. 4 Though vine nor fig tree neither their longed-for fruit should bear, though all the fields should wither, nor flocks nor herds be there, yet God the same abiding, his praise shall tune my voice; for while in him confiding, I cannot but rejoice."
801,"The Lord's My Shepherd, I'll Not Want",
802,The King of Love My Shepherd Is,"1 The King of love my shepherd is, whose goodness faileth never; I nothing lack if I am his and he is mine forever. 2 Where streams of living water flow my ransomed soul he leadeth, and where the verdant pastures grow, with food celestial feedeth. 3 Perverse and foolish oft I strayed, but yet in love he sought me, and on his shoulder gently laid, and home, rejoicing, brought me. 4 In death's dark vale I fear no ill with thee, dear Lord, beside me; thy rod and staff my comfort still, thy cross before to guide me. 5 Thou spread’st a table in my sight; thy unction grace bestoweth; and O what transport of delight from thy pure chalice floweth! 6 And so through all the length of days thy goodness faileth never; Good Shepherd, may I sing thy praise within thy house forever."
803,My Shepherd Will Supply My Need,"1 My shepherd will supply my need; Jehovah is his name. In pastures fresh he makes me feed, beside the living stream. He brings my wandering spirit back when I forsake his ways, and leads me, for his mercy's sake, in paths of truth and grace. 2 When I walk through the shades of death your presence is my stay; one word of your supporting breath drives all my fears away. Your hand, in sight of all my foes, does still my table spread; my cup with blessings overflows; your oil anoints my head. 3 The sure provisions of my God attend me all my days; O may your house be my abode, and all my work be praise. There would I find a settled rest, while others go and come; no more a stranger, or a guest, but like a child at home."
804,"Rejoice, Ye Pure in Heart!","Rejoice, Ye Pure in Heart! 1 Rejoice, ye pure in heart! Rejoice, give thanks, and sing! Your festal banner wave on high, the cross of Christ your King. Refrain: Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice, give thanks, and sing! 2 With voice as full and strong as ocean’s surging praise, send forth the sturdy hymns of old, the psalms of ancient days. 	(Refrain) 3 Yes, on through life's long path, still chanting as ye go, from youth to age, by night and day, in gladness and in woe: 4 At last the march shall end; the wearied ones shall rest; the pilgrims find their home at last, Jerusalem the blest. 	(Refrain) 5 Then on, ye pure in heart! Rejoice, give thanks, and sing! Your festal banner wave on high, the cross of Christ your King. 	(Refrain)"
805,Come Sing to God,"1 Come sing to God, O living saints; sing praises to God's name. God's anger is not permanent; God's love will never wane. Though tears may tarry for the night with sighs of deepest pain, yet joy comes with the morning sun, a peace that is not vain. 2 In my success I felt secure; how good you've been to me. I said that this is my own work, ascribing all to me. But when you turned aside your face, my life was filled with fears. I begged for help; to you I cried with loud and bitter tears. 3 What good is gained by my disgrace, what profit in defeat? My grave cannot confess your name, nor praise for you repeat. Now hear, O Lord, my plaintive cry; be merciful to me. Accept my longing heart's request and from death set me free. 4 You change my grief to joy-filled dance; my sorrows you destroy. In faithfulness you hear my cry and fill my life with joy. And so to you my heart shall sing; my voice your goodness raise. You are my God, forevermore. My life shall sing your praise."
806,I'll Praise My Maker,"1 I'll praise my Maker while I've breath; and when my voice is lost in death, praise shall employ my nobler powers. My days of praise shall ne'er be past while life and thought and being last, or immortality endures. 2 How happy they whose hopes rely on Israel's God, who made the sky and earth and seas with all their train; whose truth forever stands secure, who saves the oppressed and feeds the poor, and none shall find God's promise vain. 3 The Lord pours eyesight on the blind; the Lord supports the fainting mind and sends the laboring conscience peace. God helps the stranger in distress, the widowed and the parentless, and grants the prisoner sweet release. 4 I'll praise my Maker while I've breath; and when my voice is lost in death, praise shall employ my nobler powers. My days of praise shall ne'er be past while life and thought and being last, or immortality endures."
807,When We Must Bear Persistent Pain,"1 When we must bear persistent pain and suffer with no cure in sight, come, Holy Presence, breathe your peace with gifts of warmth and healing light. 2 Support us as we learn new ways to care for bodies newly frail. Help us endure, and live and love. Hear our complaint when patience fails. 3 We thank you for the better days when we may smile to greet the sun, to do your work with clearing mind, and bless your name when day is done. 4 In ease or pain, in life and death, to you our fragile lives belong, and so we trust you in all things. You are our hope, our health, our song."
808,When Memory Fades,"1 When memory fades and recognition falters, when eyes we love grow dim, and minds, confused, speak to our souls of love that never alters; speak to our hearts by pain and fear abused. O God of life and healing peace, empower us with patient courage, by your grace infused. 2 As frailness grows and youthful strengths diminish in weary arms that worked their earnest fill, your aging servants labor now to finish their earthly tasks, as fits your mystery’s will. We grieve their waning, yet rejoice, believing your arms, unwearied, shall uphold us still. 3 Within your Spirit, goodness lives unfading. The past and future mingle into one. All joys remain, unshadowed light pervading. No valued deed will ever be undone. Your mind enfolds all finite acts and offerings. Held in your heart, our deathless life is won!"
809,Why Has God Forsaken Me?,"1 ""Why has God forsaken me?"" cried our Savior from the cross as he shared the loneliness of our deepest grief and loss. 2 At the tomb of Lazarus Jesus wept with open grief: grant us, Lord, the tears which heal all our pain and unbelief. 3 As his life expired, our Lord placed himself within God's care: at our dying, Lord, may we trust the love which conquers fear. 4 Mystery shrouds our life and death but we need not be afraid, for the mystery's heart is love, God's great love which Christ displayed."
810,When in the Night I Meditate,"1 When in the night I meditate on mercies multiplied, my grateful heart inspires my tongue to bless the Lord, my guide. 2 Forever in my thought, the Lord before my face shall stand; secure, unmoved I shall remain, with God at my right hand. 3 My inmost being thrills with joy and gladness fills my breast; because on God my trust is stayed, my flesh in hope shall rest. 4 I know that I shall not be left forgotten in the grave, and from corruption, you, O Lord, your holy one will save. 5 The path of life you show to me; of joy a boundless store is ever found at your right hand, and pleasures evermore."
811,Make Your Face to Shine,"Make your face to shine upon your servant, and in your loving-kindness save me. Make your face to shine upon your servant, and in your loving-kindness save me. But as for me, I trust in you, O Lord. I have said, “You are my God. My times are in your hand, O God. You deliver me.” Spanish Haz resplandecer tu rostro sobre tu siervo(a); ¡sálvame por tu misericordia! Haz resplandecer tu rostro sobre tu siervo(a); ¡sálvame por tu misericordia!
